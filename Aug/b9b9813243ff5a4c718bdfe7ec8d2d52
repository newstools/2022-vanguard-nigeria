We know their trademarks and their modus operandi. “They mask themselves up, and all over them are charms in their usual way of believing that the charms they carry all about will save them.” The police boss assured us that “we are not going to stop at anything so that the state does not fall under the so-called illegal order of the IPOB when they will compel or force people to stay at home every Monday. “For this not to happen, the command is always out every week from Sunday extending to Tuesday to ensure that we are out round the clock, taking charge of all the nooks and crannies to checkmate them and I am happy that this paid off.”   JUST IN: Suspected IPOB members storm Delta, destroy vehicles, block roads In "News" IPOB block Ugbolu, Illah Road, one Audi car destroyed  Travellers, residents scamper for safety  soldiers, police deployed to restore peace, order . no life was lost- Police  By Festus Ahon  ASABA-APPREHENSION, Tuesday, enveloped, Ugbolu community, near Asaba and its environs as suspected adherents of the Independent People of Biafra, IPOB… In "News" The Police Command in Ebonyi says it has raided the Indigenous People of Biafra/ Eastern Security Network (IPOB/ESN) suspected camp, killed one and arrested another.
