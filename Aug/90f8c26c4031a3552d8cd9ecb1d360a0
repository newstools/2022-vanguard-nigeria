Speaking in Lagos during the formal launch of the Global Crusade with Kumuyi and unveiling of two books titled ‘Voyage to Liberation’ and ‘The minister shown approved’, the cleric said that mission to proclaim the gospel and bring solace to the world, which started about a year ago, has spread far and wide. His words: “Based on statistics and analysis of our media streams, the GCK, over the past year, has reached more than 150 countries with a monthly average physical audience of between 40,000 to 150,000 and virtual audience of over 3,000,000 people globally. “We have documented over 200,000 people across the world, who have been saved and transformed during these crusades. More than 30 million people have been impacted globally in the last year through the GCK.” On the motive behind the crusade, Kumuyi said: “People across the world are grappling with deep-seated emotional problems. Dependence on psychotropic drugs is on the rise. Suicide rate has spiked. It all has to do with the fallen nature of man. “While we appreciate and celebrate the strides that we have made, guided by the skillful hands of human ability, we all yearn for something more. This was the mission and mandate of the Lord Jesus Christ to the world two thousand years ago. “It is this same mandate and mission that now drives me and has led to the birth of the GCK, proclaiming the gospel and bringing solace to a world gripped with mounting and seemingly irresolvable crises. “What began as a mustard seed about a year ago with deepening roots, has spread far and wide and blossomed as we stand in awe of the mercy and might of God.”    By Gabriel Olawale The General Superintendent of the Deeper Life Bible Church, Pastor William Kumuyi yesterday said that, despite scientific breakthroughs and technological advancements, the world is still witnessing increasing economic, social, cultural and ecological upheavals all of which impact negatively on the quality of life globally.
