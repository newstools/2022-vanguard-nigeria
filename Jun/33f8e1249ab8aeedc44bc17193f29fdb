It is also important to note that the Ministry intends to extend the programme to other MDAS by January, 2023 Therefore. “I expect to receive at the end of each month a coordinated approach and plan on monitoring and evaluation of the programme by the responsible Department. “There is a great concern on how government employees manage their finances. These days.. public employees face serious financial challenges as a result of a dwindling economy. “Studies have shown that lack of primary skills on how to manage, save, and invest money is one of the reasons why public employees experience financial troubles. “Moreover, another study discovered that most public servants do not cultivate effective saving habits, rather they are likely to spend more than what they earn. Financial education, though not being a solution, can lessen the magnitude of future crises by enabling public employees to effectively use financial products and services to develop their skills and the confidence to become more aware of financial risks and opportunities to make informed choices. “These kinds of measures can also help in promoting economic recovery and growth, as well as decrease poverty”, she added. The Minister further explained that those involved in the training include; GIZ, Central Bank and the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning. She noted that the programme will run for as long as the government is able to capture the bulk of the lower cadre civil servants.
