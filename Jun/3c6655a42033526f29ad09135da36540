Attempts will be made to reconcile all aggrieved members and we will do this with the best of our ability. “We are going to reach out to all our members who hold any difference with the direction and decision of delegates and the party in the just-concluded nomination. ” We will take time to listen to their positions and complaints and take steps to address the issues they have raised.
