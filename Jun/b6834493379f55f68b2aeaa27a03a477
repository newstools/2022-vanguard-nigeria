A Nigerian man has been killed in the United State of America by a drunk driver just six weeks after arriving in the state. Tributes from family and friends have poured in for the man identified as Patrick Ohanta, 45, who was said to have been hit and killed by a car driven by a drunk driver while standing by the side of a kerb in Pineville, Louisiana. It was gathered that Patrick was walking home from a job interview at about 5.20 PM when the sad incident occurred. Louisiana State Police Troop E and the Alexandria Police Department responded to the accident that killed Patrick. APD believes impairment was a factor in one of the accidents. “Patrick was attempting to cross the Curtis-Coleman Bridge when he was struck by a vehicle driven by a 29-year-old man from Pineville. “A preliminary investigation conducted by the APD shows the man drove onto the shoulder hitting Ohanta who was pronounced dead at the scene. “The driver was taken into custody at the scene. He was booked into RPSO Jail and charged with driving while intoxicated – 4th offense, operating a vehicle while under suspension, reckless operation of a vehicle, and vehicular homicide. “A GoFundMe to support Patrick’s wife and family for the funeral has been opened. “APD is looking for witnesses who may have information about this incident. Call the Alexandria Police Department Traffic Division at (318) 441-6408.” Routine toxicology tests are pending. The crash remains under investigation. Source: Afrotimes Newspaper
