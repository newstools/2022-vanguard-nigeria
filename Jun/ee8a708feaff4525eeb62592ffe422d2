We cannot manufacture agreements. Regardless, we are not constrained from listening to the government side and pushing them to do their own bit as quickly as possible,” the Labour Ministry said in a statement issued last night. The faulted ASUU President, Professor Emmanuel Osodeke’s  comments during an interview on Channels Television that his union did not receive any invitation from the Federal Government to attend the meeting held last Thursday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
