This is not only about the rhetoric, we have to let the people know what we have done. “Political parties should be independent and not dominated by other power. “Today is a very big example, all parties, the big parties, small parties, we are equal here. I am very proud that parties can sit down even if there is competition.

If we must make speed, women must be given their rightful place. “Your Excellency, I want to seek this opportunity, we have seen the 5 plans listed and we want to put the sixth one on your agenda. “And that number six would be the women empowerment in deepening democracy and development because we want you to be specific in developing women,” Edu said.
