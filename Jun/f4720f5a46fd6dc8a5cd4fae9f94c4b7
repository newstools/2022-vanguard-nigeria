The just concluded People Democratic Party (PDP) presidential primary in Abuja rang such costly bells and is already attracting discordant notes within and outside party faithful and the electorate across the country. Indeed, PDP’s abandonment of the zoning system could be described as self-seeking and a clear lack of gauging the political temperature or mood in the country. A mood dictated by the current perceived imbalance in both elective and appointive offices, particularly at the national level. It is like cutting your nose to spite your face. The PDP, by this willful act has unknowingly shot her foot point blank and shattered her hopes of wresting power from a more than determined, more strategic and more tactical ruling party, APC, come 2023. The forceful and unsolicited concession of the presidential slot to Alhaji Atiku Abubakar as its flag bearer at its recent convention in Abuja was one act that portrayed the party as insensitive to the current clamour for balance in political representation in the choice of leadership at the highest level in the country. That, no deep reflective thought was given to the fact that the Northern geo-political zone had held tight to the highest political office in the country for almost eight years, is to say the least, most unfortunate. The very act of imposing yet another Northern presidential candidate on the nation smacks of hypocrisy, some sort of unpleasant behavior on the part of the party. However, the good news is that the All Progressives Congress (APC) has risen to the occasion in this sensitive matter of zoning and allowed good reason to prevail in the choice of their presidential flag bearer. The recent APC northern governors and critical influential stakeholders declaration for a Southern presidential candidate at the on-going party’s primary election is a master stroke. The move has certainly cut asunder PDP’s loose and feeble knot tying the presidency to the North for another eight years. It is now clear that Atiku’s presidential candidacy has an uphill task. It would be an arduous task for Atiku PDP to convince or sway the northern feverish mass mob-like action support of President Buhari’s APC to turn the other way round to cast their votes for PDP. This is notwithstanding APC’s poor, lack-lustre performance bond over the almost eight years the party has been in office at the centre. Again, it is my stand that even the frantic moves by the “Third Forces” whose aims and objectives, though good and proper, for the stability, unity and accelerated progress of the Nigerian State would make  significant difference in the choice of a Peter Obi candidacy, a Southerner for that matter.  But I doubt if this new bride can stand the powerful PDP and APC force in the battle for Aso Rock in the ensuing months leading to the 2023 presidential election. That the ruling APC government and the party has zeroed in for a Southern president is a good development. It should be roundly applauded. Going forward, it now behoves the Southern presidential aspirants to close ranks and choose amongst them who the cap fits in the circumstance, taking into account, age, cognate experience in public or private sector, ICT complaint clear knowledge of economic and financial management, financial and economic crime integrity, ability to harmess our vast and variegated human, mineral and agricultural resources, and above all, a Leadership quality that evokes our national ethos. The All Progressives Congress (APC) should, therefore, match  words with action in truly mobilizing  their teeming supporters both in the North and South to birth a truly national “Leader” who would act as a catalyst to galvanize Nigerians to inculcate in them the spirit and sense of nationalism in our march to the birth of  a “New Nigeria”. A new Nigeria, where there is oneness, peace and security, and accelerated socio-economic and infrastructural transformation. And above a all, a land where her citizens would have food on their tables and other basic necessities of life to make life more comfortable.
