It also called on the general public to take proactive measures to prevent and stop the spread of the virus in the country. Director General/Chief Executive Officer of the National Biosafety Management Agency, NBMA, Dr. Rufus Ebegba, who gave the warning in a statement yesterday, said due to the current spread of the disease, it was important for the general public to take drastic steps to stop further infection and spread of the disease. The statement read: “It is very important that Nigerians should be aware of the health risk monkeypox poses and take caution by adhering to safety measures. “The symptoms for monkeypox include sudden fever, headache, weakness of the body, which can come with body pains, sore throat, enlargement of glands under the jaw and in the neck. “It can also come with the appearance of a rash on the face, palms, soles of the feet, genitals and other parts of the body, which can appear solid or fluid-filled at the onset and can manifest within a period of two to three weeks depending on the health status of such an individual. “This illness can be transmitted from infected animals and rodents such as rats, mice, squirrels and even monkeys, through body contacts such as touching its blood, body fluids, spots, blisters or scabs and sharing of objects. ‘’To curb the spread of this virus, it is, therefore, necessary to avoid contacts with animals that could harbor the virus (dead or alive). ‘’Isolation of infected patients for a specific period of time with the practice of good hand hygiene with or without contact with infected animals or humans.” Ebegba advised that it was essential to adhere strictly to public health safety measures and report likely cases of signs and symptoms to a health facility nearest to you. According to him, the NBMA is taking proactive steps, while working with other line Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs, to ensure that bio-security measures were taken to contain the virus.
