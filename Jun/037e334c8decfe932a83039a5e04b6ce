The bishop who described the attack as evil said “the figure was from the record of the church and the list containing the names and the contacts of the deceased. ” We said the number of the people that died is 38. This is the list that contains their names and their contacts just to confirm the figure we gave out. ” What happened is bad it is only in a war situation that such things happen.” Arogundade pleaded with the traditional ruler to give the church a land to bury the victims. Responding, Oba Ajibade Ogunoye said he would consult with his chiefs on the request of the church in the provision of a land. Oba Ogunoye promised to get back to the church.
