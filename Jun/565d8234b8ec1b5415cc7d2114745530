Speaking on the occasion, the Commandant of the PTS, DCP Musa Yusuf Garba, said the people should see their decorations as a call to service and greater responsibilities. Garba charged them not to do anything that is against the Police Act, because although they are not regular police officers, they are subject to the provisions of the Act. The Headmaster of the school, SP Momoh Kabiru, explained that spy police officers also help to gather intelligence, do escort duties among others. He added that they are not allowed to prosecute offenders or run detention centers. The G1 of the set, Samuel Ajiboyede, thanked the Police authorities for the training they received.
