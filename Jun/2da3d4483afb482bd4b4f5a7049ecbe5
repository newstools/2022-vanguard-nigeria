Omotola, who is also the Group Managing Director/CEO, Master Reality International Concepts Limited, said his property on Iju Road, in the Agege area of the state, was demolished by government officials on the orders of Onigbanjo. Addressing newsmen on the development, Omotola said the land on which the property was built was claimed by one Olabisi as belonging to her late husband, tagging him a land grabber. However, Omotola said a panel set up to resolve the issue, headed by the Solicitor General, Mrs Titilayo Shitta Bey, allegedly disputed the Attorney General’s claims. “At the meeting, Mrs Shitta Bey said since two persons were laying ownership claim to the land and they have purchased from different vendors, then it’s an issue of a land dispute instead of land grabbing and that parties should go and seek redress in court since the matter is before the court,” Omotola said.

He noted that he later discovered that the Office of the Attorney General had “colluded with one CSP Akinjide Alabi of Zone 2 Police Command to forge my statement in order to develop a charge against me. “To prove my case, I subjected the statement to forensic at Alagbon FCID and the result came out to be forged. My lawyer, on the forensic report, wrote to the AG, but the letter was ignored to buttress our claim of conspiracy. I then petitioned the CSP that was used to perpetrate the forgery to the Inspector General of Police,” Omotola added. He claimed that the IG, after an investigation based on a petition he filed, wrote to Onigbanjo to inform him that all documents were forged and that no police formation carried out any investigation on what generated a charge. When Vanguard reached out to the Attorney-General on his view, he neither picked his call nor replied text message sent to him. Omotola called on Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to wade into the matter by investigating the matter.
