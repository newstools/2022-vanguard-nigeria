Keyamo in a message or congratulations to the Ekiti Governor-elect, Biodun Oyebanji said this is not the time for complacency.

Reacting to the APC victory in Ekiti, Keyamo said; “Whilst this buoys our spirits in APC and I congratulate our own Biodun Oyebanji on this momentous feat, we must keep our feet firmly on the ground as there’s greater work ahead to win the Osun Governorship election & the 2023 Presidential elections. There should be no complacency”. Oyebanji, who was the former Secretary to the State Government SSG, to Governor Kayode Fayemi, had won in 15 out of the 16 council areas of the state.
