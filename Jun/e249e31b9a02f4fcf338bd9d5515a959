By Miftaudeen Raji The House committee investigating the January 6 Thursday night has indicted the former United States President Donald Trump on the tragic incident. According to the Chairman of the Committee, Bennie Thompson, Trump was not only aware of the violence that erupted after that day’s “Stop the Steal,” rally, but also approved of it, after weeks of allegedly encouraging the insurrection. Recall that the January 6 Insurrection was a day of chaos at the US Capitol, which left several people dead and more than a hundred police officers injured. The Committee chair, Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi was accompanied by vice chair Liz Cheney, a Republican from Wyoming.
