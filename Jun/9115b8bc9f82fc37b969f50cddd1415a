A professor,  Christopher Imumolen has emerged as the presidential candidate of the Accord Party (AP), ahead of the the 2023 general elections. Imumolen, aged 39, won the party’s ticket unopposed at the AP presidential primary election held in Abuja on Saturday.  He won the primary by voice vote as a sole aspirant for the party after his co-contenders in the race had stepped down. The national chairman of the party, who described the election of Imumolen as a “sign of victory”, said the decision of the second presidential hopeful to step down was in line with the party’s motto, “Oneness and progress.” Nalado said: “The two aspirants decided to sit down and look at the situation at hand, and if two of them will start fighting, it will not give us what we want. “So they decided in their own wisdom to speak together and agree for one to step down for the other. “This a sign of victory. The two aspirants we had this morning are youths. And if you look at the attendance, more than 50% is by youths. I am sure these youths are ready to take over Nigeria. “Youths of Nigeria, you have the authority in your hand, your tongue. Use this tongue to change Nigeria. On election day, come out and use this tongue to decide who will be the president of Nigeria,” he added. Speaking on his interest in contesting the 2023  presidential election, Imumolen said he was in the race to address the leadership deficit affecting the development of Nigeria. Imumolen, an indigene of Esan West, Ekpoma in Edo State, started his work career as a Plant Engineer at BOC Gases Nigeria Plc in February 2005. The Addo of Abaji is said to possess two PhD degrees in Engineering Research and Educational Management. He is the founder of Joint Professional Training and Support International Limited (JPTS) and UNIC Foundation, a non-profit organization. Vanguard News
