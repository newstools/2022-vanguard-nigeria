Continuing, the Speaker, said, “pursuant to the provision of Section 192 (2) of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the honourable House has recieved the Executive request in good faith and has since confirmed fit for appointment. “With the cordial relationship that exist between the Executive, Legislative and the Judiciary, I want to assure the good people of Borno State that the House will immediately send the screened list to the Governor for their swearing in as soon as he (Zulum) come back from his official trip to Sudan. On the inability for troops to clear his local government headquarters (Gudumbali) from Boko Haram total control, the Speaker said, ” inhale been saying it time without numbers that the entire Guzamala Local Government Headquarter where i hail from, which is Gudumbali, is still under the control of Boko Haram sect, because there is no presence of troops or civilians as I speak. “There is no single existence of civil authority in Guzamala, not to even talk of Military presence in the Council Headquarter and its surrounding communities, our people including our Districts, stakeholders are still taking refuge in camps and host communities located in Nganzai, Monguno and other neighbouring local government areas including Maiduguri metropolis for the past six years.” The Speaker lamented.
