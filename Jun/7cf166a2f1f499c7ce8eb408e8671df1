Akpanudoedehe announced his decision in a strongly worded letter dated 4th June, 2022 and addressed to the APC Chairman of his Offot Ward 6, Uyo in Akwa Ibom State. The letter titled; ‘Resignation of my membership of the All Progressives Congress’, reads; “I write to notify you of my resignation from the All Progressives Congress (APC), forthwith. “Henceforth, I cease to be a member of the APC in my ward (ward 6 in Uyo LGA) or anywhere for that matter. I hereby relinquish all rights which inured to me as a member of the APC, member of the National Advisory Council and member of National Caucus of the APC. “This decision to part ways with the APC, is a tough one, but leadership entails adherence to the wishes of the vast majority of associates, allies and supporters who have shown fidelity overtime and have now witnessed the obduracy of the APC in handling the Candidates Selection processes in Akwa Ibom State. “Our greater goal of providing service to the people of our dear state remains sacrosanct”. Akpanudoedehe was national secretary of the parry for nearly two years under the Gov. Mai Mala Buni-led CECPC and only left at the March 26 national convention of the party where Senator Iyiola Omisore was elected in his stead. The former Minister has been having a running battle with presidential aspirant and former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio over the control of the APC structure in Akwa Ibom state.
