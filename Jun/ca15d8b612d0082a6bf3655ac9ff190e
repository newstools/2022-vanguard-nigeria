The President said the victory was well deserved considering Oyebanji’s contributions to the development of the State and the party before his nomination as the standard-bearer, urging him, however, to be magnanimous in victory in the interest of the people of the State. President Buhari also rejoiced with the APC chairman, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, and the National Working Committee for the victory, the first under the tenure of the newly elected executives of the party.  Read Also: Ekiti PDP gubernatorial candidate appreciates electorate for peaceful conduct Thank you, Biodun Oyebanji, Ekiti Governor-elect tells voters Ekiti election: Prosecute vote-buyers or face legal action, SERAP tells INEC The President in a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Chief Femi Adesina, was quoted as saying, “This is a good beginning for you and your team. The APC is getting stronger and more united. “The victory of our party in Ekiti is an indication of the confidence of Nigerians in the ability of our great party to deliver quality governance to all.” He charged all APC members across and outside the country to see this as a good omen for the 2023 general elections and work assiduously to ensure the party’s victory, continuing the trend with Osun State next month in July. President Buhari also felicitated the people of Ekiti State for the smooth conduct of the election, affirming that they are the real victors as they have been able to freely choose their leader for the next four years. He lauded the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, and the law enforcement agencies for the preparations put in place, urging them to keep the momentum for upcoming elections.
