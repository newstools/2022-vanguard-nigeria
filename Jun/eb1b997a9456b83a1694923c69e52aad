This is even as she called the attention of FG, and Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, to the ongoing strike, stating that the situation would do more harm than good. She, however, beseeched state governors to accelerate efforts in adopting the Child Rights Act across the various states. Lau made these calls during the formal inauguration of marking the ‘International Day of the African Child’, and ‘First Ever Women Women-in National Service’, WINSERVE2022, in Abuja.

It is long overdue. “We are also calling on the Federal Government and ASUU to please reopen our Universities, so that our children will be fully engaged. Incessant crises in our Educational Institutions are big threats to National Security.Children’s continuous stay at home is very worrisome to us (Mothers). “It makes them idle, redundant and therefore vulnerable to all forms of violence and negative tendencies. On the issues of National Security, we are appealing to our politicians to fear God and face these problems squarely, in the same way they are facing Party Delegates. “Just imagine how Billions of Tax-Payers money are squandered, in the recent weeks, during parties primaries. If issues ofSecurity and Education are taken in like manner, Nigeria would have been aHeaven on this Earth. “Haba! Let’s all fear Allah, and discharge our individual and official obligations. Almighty God does not sleep. We must be aware that our nation is drifting while our leaders are busy engaged in selfish and greedy political mis-adventures”, she added. Earlier in her keynote address, Frontline Politician and Member of Special Events Planning Committee, SPECOM, Hon. Edhekpo Uyoyou, stated that the commemoration of the International Day of the African Child is “being spearheaded by the African Union Secretariat, Addis-Ababa, Ethiopia. She added that: “it is a special tribute to all African Children and in particular, dedicated to the memories of those students who were massacred in Soweto, South African, in 1976, for protesting against education injustice and inequality in the unfamous apartheidregime.” She said that the NCWS in collaboration with FGN-NIMEC Projects Implementation Committee (Gender and Human Development Sector), would be organising a Women-in National Service Week, WINSERVE2022. She noted that the event is to celebrate the Nigerian Mothers and to recognize other Nigerian Amazons with merit awards and service medals. Vanguard News Nigeria
