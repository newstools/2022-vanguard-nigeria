Abia State Sector Commandant of FRSC, Mr. Paul Ugwu, who made the appeal in Umuahia during a rally to commemorate this year’s World Bicycle Day, also said that the use of bicycle helps in burning off unnecessary fats in the body. He enumerated some of the benefits of riding bicycle to include: ‘reduction of carbon emission, reduction of expensis on fuel and improvement on health generally.” The Sector Commander, however, noted some of the few challenges associated with the use of bicycle in Nigeria such as poor road infrastructure, stigma and unsafe road habits. He appealed to the wife of the Governor to partner the Corps to promote the use of bicyle as a means of movement in the state. In a remark, Abia State Governor’s wife, Dr Mrs Nkechi Ikpeazu, thanked FRSC for organising the rally, and promised to assist the Corps in raising awareness about the health benefits of using bicycles. She urged members of the public to embrace cycling as a means of movement especially in view of the numerous health and other benefits. Addressing the corps marshals and other participants at the rally when they had a stop-over at the Federal Medical Centre Umuahia, the Chief Medical Director, Professor Onyebuchi, noted that using bicycle was a regular way of exercise. He affirmed that those who use bicycle regularly are less likely to suffer from cardiovascular diseases, stroke, diabetes, obesity, depression, arthritis and other diseases associated to the lungs resulting from inhaling unhealthy emissions on the atmosphere. The CMD further said that “riding a bike is fun and a low-impact form of exercise for all ages”. Meanwhile, the Sector Commander thanked the MD for their partnership with the Command over the years, especially in area of their quick response to injured victims of road crashes. Ikpeazu’s wife and some Government officials rode on bicyle during the rally during which the Sector Commander visited a radio station in the state to sensitise members of the public on the benefits of using bicycles.
