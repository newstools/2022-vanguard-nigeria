Bandits are terrorising with impunity. Does our government really care about our pains? Something is happening, they have failed us.”  “Nigeria is a country where citizens are treated unequally because of religion and ethnicity. Vices have become a value in our country. Government should use Nigeria’s resources to recruit young men who are willing to fight insecurity in order to defend the country,” he said
