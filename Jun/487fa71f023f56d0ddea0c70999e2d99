The tragedy was confirmed yesterday in a condolence reflection by former Rivers APC governorship candidate, Dakuku Peterside, who expressed shock over the incident said to have happened along Gwagwalada Road as the victim set on the return journey to Port Harcourt. Peterside’s condolence note avoided revealing names of the victims, but reports emerging indicated that the dead include Secretary of APC, Akuku Toru Local Government Area, Onimitein Vincent Samuel who reportedly died Friday morning.
