This was contained in a Mid-Day Situational Statement on the 2022 Ekiti Gubernatorial Election released by the organization yesterday. Briefing newsmen in Ado Ekiti, the Executive Director of Yiaga Africa, Samson Itodo, called the officials of EFCC deployed to ensure full prosecution of individuals caught in the act of vote buying/voter inducement. Yiaga Africa noted that voters were prevented from voting despite holding INEC issued PVCs in areas observed by the organization. “Yiaga Africa also received reports of ballot box snatching in Ilawe Ward IV, near St. Patrick’s School. The incidents were reported in two polling units with codes 13/05/06/005 and 007.” He commended the people of Ekiti State for their peaceful conduct during the voting process and pleaded that they remain patient and peaceful through the voting and counting process. “Yiaga Africa will provide updates as the voting process comes to an end and the results collation commences. Yiaga Africa restates its commitment to sharing accurate data and information on the conduct of the election and results based on its deployment of theParallel Vote Tabulation methodology.”
