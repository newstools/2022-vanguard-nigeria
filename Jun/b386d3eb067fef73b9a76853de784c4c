Speaking during day three of Spiritual Empowerment, Ibiyeomie said whatever God doeth lasts forever, but man made doesn’t. “All of you who also have Kayan Mata, give your life to Christ because if you don’t give your life, it can also destroy you. They will not tell you the consequences of it. In case you don’t know, go and ask your mother. No woman uses charm to hold a man that lives long; find out!  “When the woman gets to a particular age, the thing will just vanish and she will die. Look at women who use charm, they don’t live long. They will have cancer or one thing that will kill them. The witch doctors will not tell you. “Satan will give you money with time bomb because he does not have anything free. He came to steal so where he stole he has to return them back. It is only whatever the Lord doeth shall be forever; whatever satan does will never be forever, it will be with sorrow. (Ecclesiastes 3:14). Return to the secret place: divine protection is reserved for the saints. Psalm 91:1. The secret place is for you to submit to the lordship of Jesus Christ, that is what we call the secret place of God. New birth is your access to crisis-free zone of life. You cannot enjoy divine protection if you are not born again. To dwell in the secret place simply means to be born again. If you are not born again, when the altar call is made make sure you give your life to Jesus.”
