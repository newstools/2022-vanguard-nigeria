Nollywood producer and actor, Yul Edochie has been mocked online by many social media users after his daughter distanced herself from him in a post on Friday. Yul’s daughter in a post on Instagram issued a warning to those linking him to her father’s marriage brouhaha, begging them to stop tagging her to any poster related to her father. She refuted the claims of being an actress or having any business with Nollywood stating that people should not force any career on her. She wrote: “Please I’m not an actress, I have no business with acting and Nollywood, No day force carer on me Abeg. I don’t act and I’m not interested in acting. Acting is for him, not me and I am a whole different person. I am on my own identity. Please stop taking me in a post related to him, Nollywood, films, and actors. I am not interested in Nollywood” However, many Nigerians faulted Yul Edochie’s daughter for making referencing her father as ‘Him’ with many people claiming she’s still feeling bad about the new marriage to Judy Austin.
