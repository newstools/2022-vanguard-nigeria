Rather than run roughshod over his party, the man begs his subordinates to let him have his way. He urges his party men to permit him to enjoy what others have enjoyed. The word he uses is reciprocity. That which is good for the gander will be good for the goose. It is not a discussion about the inherent decency of the practice.  Nigerians always say respect is reciprocal. The APC governors have heard the president’s roundabout request. He listed the qualities he wanted them to look out for. Yet he told them he wanted to do the picking. So their actual task might be to find out the man Buhari prefers and bring him to Buhari for anointing. Buhari is an enigma.  In politics, the polite man is called weak. Whether it’s politeness or aloofness, the president hasn’t been a meddlesome interloper. If Buhari had started unsettling the party at the state levels and seeking to impose local candidates, the governors would have long signed up to a peace pact. Obasanjo had fiddled with a few states. Buhari could have used his friends to fashion secession plans for one or two governors and have the forum of Progressive Governors rushing down to the Villa, seeking an audience and a truce. It’s not ideal. But in many other climes, similar things happen. Obasanjo chose reticent Yaradua. The military had chosen Obasanjo. Jonathan would have dithered and chosen someone. After all, he singlehandedly fixed Diri in Bayelsa. But since Buhari has opted for a measure of civility, he must find ways and means to secure the cooperation of a significant number of governors to make a contest against any rebellious aspirant a formality. Politics is not the church. While decency is not negotiable, holiness is not required. The man has twelve months left. In the middle of the dozen, there will be national elections which will define the political future and relevance of even expiring governors and many ambitious godfathers. Lagos is not locked down. Kano is a toss-up. Osun will be fierce. Buhari is headed for his farms in Katsina. Those who say Buhari is already a lame-duck shouldn’t forget the dreaded man should be the seemingly aloof man who has little to lose. In Lagos, Sawno Olu has been chosen again by the leader. He didn’t receive the Ambode treatment. In Lagos, ‘Baba so pe’ is the rule. In Kano, Ganduje has constructed his succession. In Rivers, Wike has anointed a fugitive. In Delta, Okwoa has ordained a lawmaker with suspicious certificates. In Kaduna, El Rufai has arranged everything. In Rivers, Amaechi has chosen Tonye Cole through the elders. All over the country, elected executives have drawn up and imposed succession plans on their parties. That is the morality of Buhari’s argument. The Igbo say a man who asks to be treated as others isn’t asking for too much. Yet some insist Buhari is promoting barracks politics. Their idea of democracy is an abstract system, without cultural underpinnings, run by angels. The truth is that our democracy is still primitive. Buhari had promised change. But we have seen Buhari and shortcomings. The old man has run his race. But Buhari bashers should remember that even saint Peter Obi chose his successor and has tried to impose his godsons on Anambra since he fell out with Obiano. Telling Buhari to stay aloof in the name of neutrality would be hypocritical idealism. Fortunately, Buhari hasn’t asked the governors to forgo party primaries. He has sought their co operation. If he had named his choice and then sold him or her to the governors and his party, it might have appeared more respectable. That notwithstanding, aspirants who feel up to it should take up the challenge and contest against Buhari and his anointed. That would present the party and delegates with the opportunity to vet the president. The president wants his successor to continue his good works. Most of the aspirants are talking about re inventing or rebuilding hope. Hopefully, the president will conduct free and fair elections in 2023 and allow the electorate to judge him.
