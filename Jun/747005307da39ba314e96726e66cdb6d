In a statement by Hon. Barr Orji Uchenna Orji, Commissioner for Information and State Orientation Ebonyi State, DUCO, which described the news purporting that Umahi had disengaged from his presidential ambition “enjoined members of the public to disregard the fake news as a cheap blackmail and absolute falsehood by desperate politicians who are apprehensive of the acceptable political profile of the Governor of Ebonyi State and Presidential hopeful and whose track records have endeared him to the heart of the APC leadership.” He added that: “Engr Chief David Nweze Umahi, APC Presidential Aspirant never stepped down, but that, His Excellency Ahmad Lawan, only returned a consultation visit previously accorded to him by Governor Umahi and that both of them pledged to support each other in event of any of them emerging as the Presidential Candidate of APC.” The statement read in part: “The attention of David Umahi Campaign Organisation has been drawn to a circulating fake news propagated in media platforms including Arise TV purporting that the Presidential Hopeful and Governor of Ebonyi State, His Excellency, Engr Chief David Nweze Umahi FNSE FNATE (Akubaraoha) has stepped down his Presidential Aspiration for His Excellency, Senator Ahmad Lawan, Senate President of Nigeria’s National Assembly. “We are surprised that Arise TV could descend so low as to take such a dirty job of running Aspirants down for needless gratifications. “We urge Arise TV to immediately purge itself of this unexpected behaviour by stating the obvious. “The clip showing the full speech of His Excellency , Ahmad Lawan and His Excellency, Engr Chief David Nweze Umahi is accompanied to this text of rejoinder for the records.”
