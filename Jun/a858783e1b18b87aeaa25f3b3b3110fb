In a period of about nine years, the Demola Ade-Ojo led company has proven many critics wrong, as it has stoutly contributed in disabusing the minds of many Nigerian auto enthusiasts who hitherto had reservations for Chinese made brands. Today, the brand has been largely accepted across the length and breadth of the country.  The company which provides sales, service, spares and finance for one of the best auto brands in Nigeria, has met the expectations of many auto patrons yawning for passenger, commercial and light duty trucks. Encouraged by the warm acceptance of the brand, the company, yesterday, unveiled yet another model- the charming JAC J7 The Sleek sedan.  Mr. Demola Ade-Ojo, managing director of Elizade Auto Land, stated during the official launching of the vehicle in Lagos, that after the acquisition of 75 percent of JAC by Volkswagen, “the merger and acquisition has helped to improve the design, quality, specification and overall experience of the passenger vehicles. The first set of car models birthed from this German- Asian infusion among others is the all new exclusive JAC J7 (#theSleek)”. The MD also announced a N1m discount for the first 10 customers to procure the vehicle immediately after the launch.  Speaking during the event, the Chairman and Founder of Elizade Auto Land, Chief Michael Ade.Ojo, was elated and full of praises for his son, saying “I am very proud of what you are doing here, my children had a strict upbringing and this is answered prayers”. The event witnessed testimonials from different customers from the private and public sectors, chief among them being the representative of the Lagos State government and the CEO of Coleman. Giving an insight into the car, the Head of Brand and Marketing Communication of Elizade Auto Land, Mr. Franklyn Okotie, said: “The car is designed with an abundance of trailblazing features that harnesses the latest technological breakthroughs to move you from your take-off point to your destination in turbo-speed. J7theSleek presents a sporty, waterfall intake grille as its unique front design and well detailed LED headlamps forming a stunning front appearance. JAC is offering the J7 with a unique threading rear backlight giving the car design a wider and sporty appearance with a streamlined hatchback body.    “You don’t have an issue with boot space, as you can easily access it seamlessly. You don’t need to touch the key to open the trunk or the car doors, the censor button on your car key controls all the locking and unlocking features even while in your pocket.  The state-of-the-art interior design is conceived for maximum comfort with quality leather seats and a dashboard that is classy and beautiful to behold.  The car seat is spacious with very extended legroom and a second seat row that integrates with the trunk to provide adequate space to accommodate more luggage with a capacity of up to six suitcases at a time. The LCD cluster helps to change the display colors on the dashboard to red, gold, and blue with controls on the steering whilst the dynamic breathing and unique ambient light moves and changes colors with the rhythm of your music”.   This console also has a Digital multimedia kit, compatible with android & apple devices.  Once your USB Cable is plugged in, it allows you to control phone features”.  The company’s image maker added-”Imagine riding a car with a 1.5 turbo charged engine and a 4-cylinder composition that can take you to new heights at an optimum speed yet very economical fuel consumption.  The car -stability/balance and spacious dimensions are second to none that you wouldn’t even notice the bump on the road.  “The cutting-edge 360 Camera sensor of the J7 detects nearby objects and shows you clear pictures of your surroundings.  You get to enjoy a wider look through the Panoramic Roof that opens all the way to give you a bird’s eye view of your surroundings.    “This function works well with your lane departure to prevent collisions with cars or objects coming behind or beside you making your driving smoother, safer, and more efficient.
