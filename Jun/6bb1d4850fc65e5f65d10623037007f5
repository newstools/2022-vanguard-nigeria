Yiaga Africa hosted a Roundtable meeting with young groups and civil society organizations for the purpose of mobilizing and engaging youths for CRV and PVC collection in Lagos. Addressing journalists after the meeting, Executive Director, Yiaga Africa, Samson Itodo said ‘’The 2023 elections is about the young people because demographically they actually have the population. They will be here for the next 20 to 30 years. So the choices that they make today will determine their future, So it is going to be an election about the young people and they have to make their numbers count and the only way they are going to make their numbers count is if they collect their PVC and they vote for leaders of their choice’’. Expressing his disappointment on the number of youths who came out to vote in the last elections in 2019,he said that the nation is in a stage where young people are not showing interest in the electoral process of the country, not to talk of voting during elections. ‘’In 2019, only 28% of young people who are registered voted at the presidential elections and 29% of them at the governorship election. So you can see that less than 30% of young registered voters are actually turning out to vote and that is very bad and that’s why we are concerned and worried. But we are doing something about it, which is getting more young people to get registered and prepare them to vote.” “But we are also making another point that if 60% of young people show up, and they are 60% of uninformed young people, then Nigeria is not going to change. So we have to get a lot of informed young people out to vote at the election. By doing so, they are voting for candidates from presidential, to state house of assembly, to the national assembly, down to governorship. They are voting candidates that have the capacity, competence, and character to hold public offices and not voting based on sentiment.” He also noted that Yiaga Africa in partnership with INEC will be organising a concert tagged ‘’Youth Vote Count 2.0’’ on the 11th of June, 2023 at Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) in Lagos with the aim of getting 100,000 young voters registered. ‘’This time we are raising it and our goal is to get about a 100,000 young voters registered using the youth vote count which holds on the 11th of June at Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) and what is interesting about this youth vote count 2.0 is that INEC is going to be registering voters at Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) from the 6th to the 11th because the entry permit into the concert venue is your PVC or the voter registration slip. So registration will be taking place by INEC and INEC will set about 30 registration points at Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS), so we are inviting unregistered voters to come there and get registered. The goal is to reach a hundred thousand in each state that the concert will hold directly and get them on the voters register that will be 600,000. The youth votes count concert that on 11th June in Lagos, we are flagging off from Lagos and then we will go to Abuja. The plan is to go to 6 cities and in the 6 geo political zones like we did in 2019 where we went round 6 universities when INEC was registering voters while the event was taking place and in 2019 through the youth vote count INEC registered 25,000 students. So the goal is to reach 100,000 in each state directly and get them on the voters register. With this alone we have a chance of getting 600,000 young voters’’ he said. Mr. Samson commended INEC towards the introduction of online registration which is the first of its kind in Nigeria electoral process but still urged the body to plan ahead so as to increase the use of technology for electoral process. ‘’I think for the 2027 elections we’ve got to prepare to increase our use of technology for the electoral process and whatever that translates at least we have a law now that allows INEC to experiment with electronic voting. So maybe after the 2023 elections we should incrementally introduce electronic voting machines in this whole value chain of electoral technology that the country seems to have adopted in the last 10years,” he added.
