Enabulele said he will be leading a 30-member delegation of the CMA to the session which will be centered on the current crisis of Human Resource for Health and its link with health inequality in the Commonwealth of Nations.  Calling on physicians, health administrators, other health professionals who wish to join the CMA delegation to the session billed to hold on June 21, 2022 to quickly indicate so through the email:osahoncmavp@gmail.com, he stated that a team of experts have been assembled to brainstorm on the chosen theme of the CMA session: Human Resource for Health and Health inequality in the Commonwealth: a Critical Appraisal of Brain Drain amongst healthcare professionals and workers in the Commonwealth of Nations.”
