He noted that he would defeat his opponents to become the next governor of Ekiti state.  Kolawale disclosed this moments after casting his vote. His words: “I want to assure you that the good people of Ekiti state need this change seriously. They cannot wait to have me sworn in as their next governor”. However, refuting rumours that he has stepped down for the candidate of the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC, Mr Abiodun Oyebanji, PDP candidate confidently said:  “I just finished casting my vote now, you should refute that claim. I will be the next governor of Ekiti state”. On the assessment of materials, Kolawale said it’s a great improvement on the part of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, unlike before. Note that Mr Abiodun Oyebanji, is backed by Governor Kayode Fayemi and the former Governor and current Minister of Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo.
