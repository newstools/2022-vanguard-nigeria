The Director-General, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu Campaign Organisation, Kashim Shettima, has emphasised that Tinubu is the only presidential aspirant that All Progressives Congress, APC, can bank on to defeat Atiku Abubakar of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP. Shettima, who spoke on Channels TV on Friday, maintained that Tinubu is the only aspirant, who has all the requirements to match and overshadow Atiku. According to him, APC doesn’t have any other options or name recognition that sells across all the regions that make up Nigeria. He said Tinubu is rich in terms of the intellect, ability and the capacity to win the forthcoming 2023 presidential election and move Nigeria forward. Shettima, who however, acknowledged that the dynamics have changed with the emergence of Atiku as the presidential candidate of the PDP, noted that Tinubu’s brand name is unmatched in Nigeria. He said, “He is not the best among his equals. He is the best among his mentees. Certainly, he is the best.” Meanwhile, Shettima dismissed the notion that Tinubu would step down. “The issue of stepping down does not arise. He is the elephant in the room. “How do you expect an elephant to step down for a Lilliputian? “On a more serious note, the issue of (Tinubu) stepping down is mere speculation,” he said. Shettima said if President Muhammadu Buhari would anoint any candidate, it would be Tinubu, adding that Tinubu would put up a good performance at the primary, regardless. He said people tend to underrate the depth of relationship between Buhari and Tinubu, adding that the President is a man of conscience, who holds Tinubu in high esteem. Vanguard News
