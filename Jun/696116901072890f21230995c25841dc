He has also tasked the presidential aspirants from the South to emulate the President and the Northern governors by imbibing the spirit of equity, justice and fairness to ensure their consensus candidate emanate from South East extraction. Nwosu,a chieftain of the APC described the decision of both Buhari and the governors as a display of patriotism and sportsmanship. Recall that 11 Northern governors under the platform of the APC had written the President after their meeting to allow power to shift to the South by picking the APC candidate from that region, saying such would promote national cohesion. Reacting to the development during interview with reporters in Abuja, Nwosu who has been in the forefront of the clamour for a Nigerian President of Igbo extraction, urged the presidential aspirants from the South to emulate the President and the Northern governors by imbibing the spirit of equity, justice and fairness. According to him, “from the outcome of the meeting between the aspirants and the President Saturday night, it is obvious that power will shift to the South. I want to salute the courage of the Northern governors, they displayed what the spirit of a true Nigerian should be. This is simply patriotism at the highest level. “Now the issue is when we get to the South, we should also toe the part of equity and fairness and ask which soon has not held power. Remember that the South West has done eight years as President under Olusegun Obasanjo and eight years as Vice President under Professor Yemi Osinbajo and the Speaker of the House of Representatives at the same time, which is uncommon, the South-South had six uninterrupted years under President Goodluck Jonathan. The only zone that is yet to take a shot at the Presidency, is the Southeast. “Now that the issue of power shift to the South has matured, we should come together and pick a strong candidate that is acceptable across all divides. We cannot be accusing the North of wanting to remain in power when we are guilty of the same thing. It is time for equity, fairness and justice”. On how the party can arrive at a “strong” candidate, Nwosu advised that that the aspirants should look among themselves and support that one that is most acceptable among Nigerians that can fix and unite the country if elected President. He also advised the delegates to put national interest above mundane considerations as they vote to elect the APC candidate at the primaries. “To the delegates, I want to plead that we consider the future of our children and the country, we shouldn’t sell our conscience for momentary gains and jeopardize the future. We should consider the character and nature of the candidate we want to elect, the one that can listen and work with Nigerians of all faith and tribe to build a country of our collective dream”, Nwosu advised,
