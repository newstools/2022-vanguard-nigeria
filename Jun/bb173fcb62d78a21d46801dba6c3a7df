“A father may only be a dad for a little while, but he’s a son’s hero forever.” – Amy Hoover Father’s Day was celebrated on the third Sunday of June for the first time in 1910. It is celebrated in the United States and other countries including Nigeria. It was founded by Sonora Smart Dodd, the daughter of American Civil War veteran, William Jackson Smart, and was responsible for the founding of Father’s Day. Father’s Day has been adopted by sons and daughters to celebrate their dads across the globe. In extension, wives also see their husbands as fathers and honour them for fatherly roles they play. As we celebrate another Father’s Day 2022, here are a few cheap gifts to get in honouring fathers. Fathers can be gifted with vintage straight ties or bow ties. A very classic grey, blue or black tie will look good any of their shirts. Mugs that have simple prints on them to appreciate their fatherly love are also good as gifts. They will appreciate you anytime they use them to drink. Cufflinks add to the charismatic status of every father when they wear them. They serve as good gifts to dads, especially those who like to wear long-sleeves. Lift up his socks collection from regular “old daddy” patterned socks to fun patterns of neutral black, grey and white colour scheme that will go with everything. One beautiful pair of pyjamas can be the best gift you will honour your dad with, and it can go a long way in celebrating for that year. Fathers look handsome in their pyjamas and be sure your dad will love you if give him one.
