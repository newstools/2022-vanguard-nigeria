I was thinking of what to do when Mariam’s husband paid us a visit.  He didn’t know I’d arrived, he came to ask Gbola to warn Sesan off his wife.  He said he had gone to work as usual, but felt ill and went back home unexpectedly.  “I heard moanings from the bedroom and ran upstairs.  I tried to turn the bedroom door handle but it was locked. I was enraged, something was definitely going on that shouldn’t.  I forced the door open and to my disgust, my wife was in bed with Sesan on top of her.  Both of them were naked.  Sesan was in shock.  Without thinking, he leapt from the bed and ran out of the house.  When I looked out of the bedroom window, he was clutching his clothes and running like a man possessed in one of my towelling robes.  I was livid.  I slapped Mariam a couple of times and threatened to let Gbola know what was going on, I didn’t know you’d arrived the country.  “How could Mariam have stooped this low?  Her husband persuaded me to come with him so we could both talk some sense into her.  What choice did I have?  Besides, I was curious to know what madness possessed her to do what she did knowing all she had to lose.  Sesan could never offer her a fraction of the luxury she enjoyed with her husband.  She was mildly shocked when she saw me and said the bedroom incident was a one-off.  Weeping profusely, she begged her husband it would never happen again – that Sesan was infatuated with her and she was more or less blackmailed emotionally to sleep with him.  “I had to plead with her husband to give her another chance.  The poor man was obviously besotted with her as he readily forgave.  When Mariam saw me off, I told her I’d seen some of the texts and picture messages she sent to my step-son. She looked a bit embarrassed but promised that would be the end of the affair.  So you can imagine how shocked I was when Gbola told me he believed the relationship was still on.  That despite all their promises, the lovers couldn’t keep away from each other and had began texting again.  Sesan had even gone to Mariam’s house for sex at least once.  That did it!  “This time, I knew her husband would be at work and really laid into her when I called at her house.  How could she consciously destroy everything she’d built over the years?  “It was then she confessed her husband was almost impotent.  That Sesan saved her marriage in a way and he hadn’t done anything that he didn’t want to.  I had to call my husband to tell him everything, the way the affair was going, Mariam’s husband could resort to desperate measures – especially if he lost his house along with his wife.  My husband had to show Sesan the depth of his disapproval by coming down as soon as he could. This time, Sesan wasn’t as defiant as he was when I appealed to him to leave Mariam alone.  In fact, he was scared especially when his dad threatened to throw him out of the house.  “We haven’t heard anything yet from Gbola and I pray that Mariam sees reason. London is a very cosmopolitan city and she could get any young stud she wants; there are agencies that specialize in things like that without putting your marriage in jeopardy.  Poor Sesan didn’t have a chance against a desperate house-wife with a lot of money and time on her hand.  We only hope that he’ll have enough will- power to wean himself off the forbidden fruit he’d bitten into…”
