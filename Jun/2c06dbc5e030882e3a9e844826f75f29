Besides creating wealth out of those discarded materials, the aim is also to reduce the wastes littering our surroundings and therefore curb pollution. As usual, Alexis Galleries is responding to this global environmental need by presenting a group exhibition of exploratory artworks titled “Recycled Matter”, featuring four talented visual artists – Samuel Nnorom, Yusuf Durodola, Konboye Eugene and Chukwuemeka Osisiego. The exhibition, which began June 11, 2022, runs till June 25, 2022. “By taking a vivid look at materiality and the environment,” says Curator Mathew Oyedele, “the exhibition examines issues that originate from the local but are connected with vital global conversation.”  Nnorom is exhibiting 3 works titled “Venus of colour”, “Venus of space” and “Around my heart” which he says is dear to his heart because he produced it immediately after his wedding. It was an expression of the love he found which he needed to translate into art. “The piece is mainly a colour distribution of purple and yellow. I used the yellow to guide the heart.” Nnorom sources his materials from tailors’ wastes. “My fabrics have conceptual meanings. I look at them as a structure in a social context – as in the social structure, the fabric of the society, etc.,” he says. According to Oyedele, “the history and social significance of Ankara fabric takes centre stage in Nnorom’s works as he dialogues with the concept of space, distribution and distance.”  Konboye Eugene is also featuring 3 works – “Do I” (1 & 2) and “Immaculate”. His major theme is children. “I look at children’s simplicity, purity and their flexibility. I work primarily with flip-flops, that is sleepers, any form of rubber shoes. Those are things you can find in our environments, in every home, because they are affordable and simple.” Konboye explores the theme of children as the future. Getting it right with children, he says, is the basis of a better environment.     Osisiego, on his own part, continues his inquiry into the Aristotelian concept of “Maintaining the Golden Mean” where he advocates for courage and equilibrium in place of excesses and recklessness,” says Oyedele. “In these pieces, he intensifies his exploratory journey by incorporating aluminum cans into his wooden materials.” Yusuf Durodola comes to the show with “Pensive” (3 & 4) and “Self-Appraisal”. “My work is a blend of painting, performance and recycling. But for this exhibition, I am showing my recycling work. We are in the era where recycling is actually what matter most, because it is something that is affecting our existence. There is no way we can survive as humans without a space, and when that space is being tampered with, we can no longer live a normal life. “There is a synergy between the space and the people living in that space. If the space is having an issue, it is our responsibility to tackle what is affecting the space, and that is the essence of having this exhibition titled “Recycling Matter,” says Yusuf.    “Alexis Galleries,” according to the founder, Patty Chidiac Mastrogiannis,  “know the importance of growth and relevance. This is why we are presenting “Recycled Matter” as a window into the relevance and significance of artists to respond to issues in their immediate environment, and by extension, issues around the world. “In this exhibition, we have presented you with the artists’ commitment, labour and dedication to reduce environmental degradation and save the earth. We hope you see the pieces and get inspired.” The exhibition is sponsored by Pepsi, Tiger, Indomie, Mikano, The Guardian, AMG Logistics, Haier Thermocool, U.P.S, Aina Blankson, Lost in a City, Cobranet, Art Cafe, WazobiaTV, Lipton, Nigeria Info FM, and Rentokil Boecker.

Yusuf is a prolific and versatile artist whose genre of work blurs the boundaries of painting, recycling and up-cycling, and performance/video/photography art. His recycling practice focuses on the materials that threaten environmental sustainability and channels it to address the issue of infrastructural decline, waste management, environmental pollution, echo systems, and sensitization. He employs African symbols and draw inspiration from Yoruba cosmology (language, philosophy, adages, oral tradition, and moral expression). These include the culture of his immediate environment, oftentimes projected through different art forms. Based on his belief that art has a strong connection to our sustainability, he uses his body as a mobile object in public spaces to bring the healing power of art to the consciousness of the populace. His penchant for pattern construction and drawing plays a prominent role in the creative process of his performances, often generated from both secular and sacred objects. His work serves as a requisite to stimulating discourses on our political and social challenges that jeopardize our collective reality. It also serves as the voice of the voiceless within the community. His works communicate the numerous perspectives, perceptions, behaviours, and mindset of individuals who exist in his immediate environment. His practice seeks to stir, engage, stimulate, refresh, and spur human minds towards a state of consciousness beneficial to humanity and the world as a whole.
