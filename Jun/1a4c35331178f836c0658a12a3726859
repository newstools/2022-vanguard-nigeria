The unit which was saddled with the responsibility of complementing other formations of the Corps across the nation to stamp out oil thieves and the criminal elements vandalizing the nation’s  critical national assets and infrastructure has also destroyed illegal refineries where adulterated petroleum were produced and distributed across the country, within the period under review. These vandals  have dammed  the devastating environmental pollution and health hazards posed  by illegal refining and  oil bunkery, as they return to the same illicit business even after the destruction of their  illegal refineries. They also do not put into consideration the dire consequence of their action on their lives. Two  months ago , scores of persons were burnt beyond recognition in an explosion that rocked an illegal oil refinery depot on the border of Rivers and Imo States . Ondo In a determined move to avert another disaster, the CG’s Special Intelligence Squad   uncovered an illegal dumpsite /storage facility at Olowo Community in  Odigbo Local Government Area of  Ondo state, few days after the  blast in the South- South region of the country. In this operation, eight   suspects who  were loading the suspected adulterated products into the storage were arrested.  Ninety- eight kegs (25 litres ) filled with adulterated Diesel  were being loaded into a black Toyota Sequoia with registration number  APP 134 DX,  when the operatives swooped on the suspects. In addition to these were 19   (25 litres) jerricans ,five drums  of 200 litres of suspected AGO, two  drums of 200 litres capacity, half filled and  two  drums of 200litres capacity quarter filled . Also,  two  storage tanks with 3500 litres of adulterated AGO each and  an  underground storage tank with four compartments were  discovered at the scene.  One of the compartments   had  2,800 litres , another  1,500 litres , the third  16,500 litres of adulterated Automated Gas Oil,AGO while the fourth one  was empty. Six pumping machines and a counting machine used to transfer and measure the quantity of petroleum products were also recovered at the scene. Earlier , while patrolling the  Iju-Osun waterfront in Irele Local Government Area of  the state, the squad intercepted two suspects alleged to have hijacked a  barge containing Automated gas Oil ,AGO. Preliminary investigation as gathered showed that the barge was hijacked  from Escravos in Delta and was heading to Siluko in Edo when it was intercepted. Delta Also , the Squad  as gathered , recently destroyed  five  illegal refineries in Delta South Local Government Area of Delta State,  during which two suspects were arrested while others managed to escape. An Intelligence report  according to the Squad,  revealed that the site belonged to three individuals among who was  a woman. Edo State In Edo State,  an illegal depot was uncovered  at Ahor, along Benin-Lagos  road where diesel was  being adulterated, with two suspects  arrested   with  950,000 litres of adulterated diesel . Rivers  Furthermore, statistics at Crime Guard disposal revealed that in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State , 15 suspected oil thieves were arrested with six trucks and a bus loaded with  suspected illegally refined Automotive Gasoline Oil. Akwa-Ibom Three months ago in Akwa-Ibom, 14 suspects were arrested with 1,700 litres of adulterated AGO in four different locations within  Itu and Onna Local Government Areas of the state. Prominent Nigerians behind illegal bunkery  Owing to several arrest of these suspects, one would have expected there to be a drastic reduction in activities of illegal oil bunkerers and vandals. Astonishingly, their illegal activities are discovered to be unabated because of an alleged involvement of prominent Nigerians in the illicit oil business  considered lucrative. Some of these individuals as reliably informed,  include both serving and retired uniform men. This disclosure was made by the NSCDC spokesman in Delta State, Emeka Peters. Peters  said confessional statements by suspects and subsequent investigation , revealed the so-called big guns were  behind  crude oil theft, pipeline vandalism, illegal refineries, economic sabotage and a host of other socio-economic crimes under the purview of the NSCDC.  He however did not disclose their identities but said, “Heads will roll, if the corps decides to publish the names of those behind crude oil theft, pipeline vandalism among others. “Suspects have  revealed some of the identities of their sponsors .The force is poised to publish names indicated from the confessional statements made by suspects. They  contained names of high profiled personalities, respected leaders in the societies, as well as  retired and serving uniform personnel and their relatives”. CG speaks Reiterating the NSCDC’s determination to  fight the scourge,  the Commandant General,  Dr. Ahmed Audi  in a speech to mark his one year in office, disclosed that  ”In the last six months, the Corps has arrested about 461 suspects for various offences ranging from  vandalization and attacks on Critical National Assets and Infrastructure (CNAI), cattle rustling, banditry, attacks on farmers and farmlands and  illegal mining.”  ”Owing to the critical nature of these assets and infrastructure to national security and socio-economic development, adequate security is now being emplaced to safeguard the Country’s Critical National Assets and Infrastructure by this Corps. “In this connection, the newly established Commandant General’s Special Intelligence Squad has been taking proactive and pragmatic steps through discrete investigation and intelligence gathering to track down these criminal elements to avert and checkmate their criminal intentions. This Squad also provides back-up to the States’ Special Forces and Anti-Vandal Squad in curtailing crime and criminality” He added that his administration had embarked on a mission to reorganize and revolutionise the training apparatus of the corps in order to sharpen the skills and competencies of the personnel to effectively cope with the challenges of dangerous developments of insecurity in the country occasioned by the activities of bandits.
