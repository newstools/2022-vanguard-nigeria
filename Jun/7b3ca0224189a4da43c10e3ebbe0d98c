According to the actor, he was brought in to rescue the reality TV show. Anchored by Toke Makinwa, the show   commenced from Saturday, October 16, 2021, and ended on December 19. But during the last two episodes of the show, the organizers decided to reintroduce Bob-Manuel Udokwu who anchored it for five out of a total of 10 years (2004 – 2013). However, the  organizers last year made some changes in the presentation of the show by introducing a Task Master alongside the anchor. But when  the chips were down, they reached out to the actor to make the difference. Speaking during a live chat with Vanguard on Instagram, Bob-Manuel said he accepted to  make a celebrity appearance at last year’s edition because of his love for the show. “I wasn’t the person that anchored season 1 and season 2. I came in to anchor season 4 after the organizers changed the host of season 3, when the show was almost crashing and I lifted it again. And today, I have become the longest anchorman of GUS. ‘At the time I came in to anchor the show, I didn’t have a long drawn out contract with the Nigeria Breweries , organizer of the show. I did the best I could. What they used  to do is to give me a one year contract. I would  host the show and take my leave. “But each year, they would  look around in search of another competent host. For last year, they chose to use a lady as host, but along the line, I was brought back to do damage control for  the show.” “I accepted to return because of my love for the Gulder Ultimate Search,”Bob-Manuel  explained.
