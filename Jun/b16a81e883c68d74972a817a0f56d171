The song, which has dropped months back is being followed with a video that will celebrate Nigeria’s unity in diversity. Speaking on the inspiration behind the new song, Uzo explained that, “Nigeria preaches unity, love and oneness. With this song, I’m calling on all Nigerians to come together as one and rebuild this country. “Nigeria is a unity song, . It was purposely done to unite us. Let us not allow religion, ethnicity and politics to divide us. Someday, I might decide to marry a Yoruba woman and eat ewedu. I am wearing a Yoruba outfit now and my name is Uzoma Omenka Day. “This song is for our youths. If we can put aside our differences and unite again, Nigeria is the future of the world. I believe in Nigeria. I am calling on those who have turned Nigeria into a killing field to have a rethink. Let’s go back to the days where the country was a better place to live. “I wasn’t born during the Nigerian civil war. In our own generation, we want peace, we want to make money and live a good life devoid of social disorder,” Uzo explained. Omeka Day, who was spotted at the National Theatre, Iganmu, Lagos , recently, where he was shooting the video of the song, used the opportunity to thank the Minister of Arts and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed and CEO, National Theatre, Professor Sunday Ododo for their support.”
