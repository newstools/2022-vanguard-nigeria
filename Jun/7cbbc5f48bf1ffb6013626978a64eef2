God understands our situation.  “I will stop attending church programmes for some time until the government provides security around worship centres. I will pray and worship God in my house. There is no security anywhere,” she said However, those who attended said they believed the assailants will stay off the town for now with the number of security operatives drafted to the town and its environs.  An Octogenarian, Pa Samuel Ogumodede, said “we will continue to pray to God to restore peaces to the world and this ugly attack should not stop us from worshipping God. “Many people are still traumatised over the attack and they are scared of coming to church but I know with time, things will return to normal. “But we must all be vigilant , we must not leave security in the hands of government alone, security should be  everybody’s concern whether you are in your house or you are in the market or in the church or you are in the Mosque.  Meanwhile, security operatives deployed to the town by the inspector General of were seen moving around the town.
