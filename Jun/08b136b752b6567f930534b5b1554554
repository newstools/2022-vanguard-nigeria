Recall that the federal government slammed a 23-count charge against the late gospel singer’s husband, which borders on domestic violence and homicide. The defendant, whose wife allegedly died as a result of prolonged assault by him, pleaded not guilty to all the allegations that were contained in the charge the Federal Government preferred against him.
