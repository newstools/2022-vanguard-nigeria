By Emmanuel Okogba Rafael Nadal qualified for his 14th French Open final after an injury to Alexander Zverev brought the game to an abrupt end in the second set. Both players were tied at 6-6 when Zverev tripped over and sustained a nasty injury to his right leg. The first set had ended in favour of Nadal 7-6 (10-8). Zverev returned to Chatrier on crutches after he was taken in by his team for examination, with Rafael Nadal by his side as the crowd chanted his name. ‘I wish Zverev all the best’ Nadal after the game was ended described Zverev’s injury as unfortunate and wished the German all the best “Very tough and very sad for him [Zverev]. He was playing an unbelievable tournament. He’s a very good colleague on the tour, I know how much he is fighting to win a Grand Slam. “For the moment, he was very unlucky. The only thing I am sure is that he is not going to win just one but more than one. I wish him all the best and a very fast recovery. “It had been a super tough match, over three hours, and we didn’t finish the second set. It’s one of the biggest challenges on the tour today when he’s playing at this super high level. It is difficult to say a lot of things in this situation. “Being in the final of Roland Garros one more time is a dream, no doubt, but at the same time, to finish that way… I have been there in the small room with Sascha before we came back out. To see him crying, it is a very tough moment. all the best to him and all the team.” Nadal will compete in his 30th Grand Slam final against the winner of the second semi-final between Casper Ruud and Marin Čilić.
