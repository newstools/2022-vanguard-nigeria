Dear Bunmi, I LOST my wife a few years ago in an unfortunate motor accident, and had made up my mind to re-marry. We were married for over 20 years and she was a good mother to our three boys. Late last year, I was introduced to a divorced lady at a close friend’s birthday party and we hit things off right away. The love-making was good and I was already toying with the idea of proposing marriage. Then, all of a sudden, her attitude changed. Thinking she wanted re-assurance, I had a talk with her that she had my undivided love and I would do anything to make her happy. You can then imagine how shocked I was when she said all she wanted was the physical side of the relationship; that she had no wish to re-marry and that I had better start shopping for a wife-material! What type of a women behaves like this? It would have been understandable if she were a frivolous teenager, but she’s close to 40. What are our women turning into?

What to you was a big romance was obviously a casual fling to this woman – now she’s telling you to get a life! Lasting relationships are built on friendship and shared ideas and dreams; not just love-making. Without these feelings, you soon realise you’re saddled with someone you don’t really know, after the love-making cools. Keep your dignity, try to wash this woman off your life and look for another woman out there eager to make a commitment.
