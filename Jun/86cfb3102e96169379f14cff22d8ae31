Says new Lagos PDP ‘ll resist APC attempts to disenfranchise electorate By  Olasunkanmi Akoni The Lagos Peoples Democratic Party, PDP Governorship candidate in 2023 poll, Dr. Olajide Adediran, popularly called Jandor, has cautioned the All Progressive Ms Congress, APC government in Lagos State to desist from alleged harassment and intimidation of residents in the process of exercising their civic responsibilities. Reacting to the reported intimidation of Alaba Market traders who shut their stalls to ensure they register before the closing date, Jandor warned that “this time, Lagos PDP will not put itself in the defensive.” Jandor therefore, charged the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC on the need to take proactive measures in forestalling rising incidences of glitch in the exercise. He said rising complaints from residents at various registration centers across the state on the slow pace of the registration exercise require urgent attention. Some residents in Amuwo Odofin, Ajeromi/Ifelodun, Ojo, Oshodi-Isolo and a few other Local Government Areas in Lagos West Senatorial district, had on Thursday, expressed disappointment over their inability to register for the permanent voters card (PVC) due to what they described as deliberate attempt by INEC officials in collaboration with the ruling party to disenfranchise them.  Traders from Alaba International Market who shut their stalls to allow them participate in the continuous voters registration exercise were frustrated with the lackluster performance of the INEC officials.  It was reported that some of the traders were attacked by politically motivated thugs because of their perceived sympathy for the PDP.  Jandor in his reaction, called on INEC to respond swiftly to the reactions of the affected residents who are willing to perform their civil obligation before the deadline set for the exercise.
