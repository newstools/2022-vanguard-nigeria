Akeredolu made the clarification during a meeting with aspirants and new candidates of the party in Akure weekend. The governor also hailed the party state Chairman, Ade Adetimehin for managing the various contending forces in the party to produce a violence-free primary election. He said “though no exercise of that nature could be perfect, the party has done well in producing quality candidates across the State. The governor charged candidates, stakeholders and leaders of the APC in the state to work assiduously for the party to record total victory in the 2023 general elections. He maintained that the party must work in unity to ensure that the three senatorial seats, the nine seats of the House of Representatives as well as the 26 seats of the state House of Assembly are won by the APC. The governor who pointed out that there were no losers in the APC primaries in the state, said that the tickets of the party are collectively owned by all those who participated in the primary elections. While absolving the state chairman of the party of any wrongdoing in the process, Akeredolu cleared the air on the rumoured imposition in the party, noting that he didn’t not impose any aspirant on the party. “We cannot and we must not lose any seat. Not even in the House of Assembly.. We must have three senators this time around. We cannot lose anywhere. This coming election is a very vital one. Your campaign must be APC-based. Appealing to your co-contestant is very important,” he noted. Earlier, the party state chairman, Ade Adetimehin, said that everyone is a winner. Adetimehin said: “All of us are winners. Whatever that has happened should be seen as a family affair. I want to appeal to those who stepped down. I am here to appeal that we must work together. We do our things in Ondo state in a very colorful way. Let us see the contest as a contest within the family.” The winner of the Senate primary in Ondo South senatorial district, Dr. Jimoh Ibrahim, who described the exercise as peaceful, free and fair, said Adetimehin has demonstrated over and over again his political prowess in managing a big party like the APC in the State. One of the aspirants who lost in the Senate primary in Ondo Central, Mr. Tola Awosika, also commended the leadership of the party under Adetimehin for providing a level playing ground for all the aspirants and ensuring a free and fair exercise. One of the aspirants for House of Assembly in Akure South Constituency 1, who withdrew ahead of the primary to concede to party supremacy, Prince Ebenezer Adeniyan, said he took the decision in difference to the leadership and encouragement provided for aspirants by Adetimehin.
