His words: ” I want to use this opportunity to congratulate you on your successful retirement from active service. I acknowledged your sacrifices and resilience in the course of defending our fatherland, especially in the fight against terrorism in the North East Area of Responsibility (NEAR). “I reiterate that there is an ongoing process to re-engage some of you, (discharged/retired military personnel) who are qualified to complement efforts of troops restore peace in the North East and country in general. “Therefore, I urge all retired military personnel across the country not to rest on their oars, but to continue support directly or indirectly on the ongoing fight against Boko Haram, banditry and other criminalities bedevilling the Nation. ” I enjoined you to take advantage of the various welfare scheme open to all retired military personnel”. General Yahaya stated. The Special Guest of Honour, Major General Bulama Biu (rtd), charged the retirees to shun all attitudes that will jeopardize the integrity of the Nigerian Army while mingling with their host communities. Major General Biu, who had served as the GOC 7 Div up to 2020 said, it is a great honour and privilege to see his friends and fighters who were all on the battlefield together up to 2020 before he left the theatre. “I am glad to celebrate together with these gallant troops who have retired from active service but are not tired. “They have contributed immeasurably towards the restoration of peace in the country, and the northeast in particular. ” I commend CoAS for ensuring proper welfare of staff, especially the retired ones, for which I was also a beneficiary”. Gen Biu said.

Earlier in his welcome address, the GOC, 7 Div, General Shaibu said, every military man who has dedicated their life to serving their fatherland deserves appreciation. To this end, he said, the celebration and hosting of the retired officers and men was a brainchild of COAS’s philosophy of professionalism that is geared towards the protection and defence of the integrity of the nation. The GOC prayed to those who have paid the supreme price, for God to grant their souls eternal rest and comfort their families.  “We celebrated with you wholeheartedly, we will continue the giant strides you have left behind to ensure total restoration in the northeast”.
