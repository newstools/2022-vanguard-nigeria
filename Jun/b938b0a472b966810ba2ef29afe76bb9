Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Dr. Folasade Yemi-Esan stated this in Abuja while addressing newsmen after a Special Juma’at Prayer to mark the 2022 Civil Service Week. Represented by Dr. Nasir Sani Gwarzo, Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Yemi-Esan said the President Muhammadu-led government reforms prioritize training and re-training to enhance effective and efficient management of resources by workers. According to her, under its Leadership Enhancement and Development Programme (LEAP-P),a key component of the first pillar of the FCSSIP, there is capacity building and talent management of workers. “The crop of civil servants that will emerge after the reform process will be one of the best in the world.” On alleged corruption in the civil service, Yemi-Esan said: “The Head of the civil service has put civil service on a revolutionary pathway. When we arrive at that destination, it is going to be the best,” she assured. On his part, Presiding Imam of National Mosque, Abuja, Dr. Ahmad Onilewura, urged civil servants to live with the fear of God.
