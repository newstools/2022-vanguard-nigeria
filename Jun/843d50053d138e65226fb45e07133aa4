Big Brother Naija Shine Ya Eye housemates, Pere and Beatrice have admitted both had interests in each other while in the house. You would recall that while in the house, Pere called Beatrice to the corner of the garden for a private discussion and declared that he likes her. The 36-year-old ex-soldier started the conversation by telling Beatrice how sweet she is, encouraging her not to think otherwise. Pere revealed that he knew Beatrice liked him and would love to have an intimate relationship with him. He talked for a while before revealing his intentions by telling Beatrice that he liked her and believes that they can become more than friends. However, in the reunion show on Friday, when Ebuka asked Beatrice what went on between her and Pere, she said, “I liked Pere from the beginning when I entered the house, you know. I saw the fine dark tall guy and I really liked him and something wanted to happen ..like a couple of thing”. Also speaking about her, Pere stated that if Beatrice had lasted longer in the house, something would have happened. “If she had stayed longer something would have happened”. Ebuka who was surprised at the bold revelation asked if it would have been possible with Maria in the picture, Beatrice interrupted and said it would have worked. “Even with Maria in the picture. Firstly, I am a very beautiful girl, and secondly I think I have all it takes to take who I like that’s to get a man who I like back”.
