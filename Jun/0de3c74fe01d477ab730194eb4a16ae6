The group, which commended the Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar for picking him ,said the choice of Okowa not only strikes a balance of religion, but also douses tension on the quest for Igbo Presidency, knowing fully well that he’s a Delta Igbo. “Nigerians can’t afford to face any sectarian crisis caused by a lopsided political arrangement in addition to the current problem of banditry and terrorists activities.,” it stated.  The Coordinator, Coalition of Arewa Forum for Good Governance, Malam Garba Yunusa, who this stated during a press conference in Kaduna ,also expressed worry over what he described as,” unnecessary delays” in presidential candidates picking running mates. While noting that the electorate now have a choice should any political party decides to go other way, Yunasa said,”Atiku has proved to be more prepared for race ahead than others.” He said as group of concerned Nigerians, “We were worried and conscious about issues of equity,  justice and fairness in choices of running mates for presidential candidates, especially under the prevailing tension created by agitation secession in southern part of the country ,but with the main opposition party ,PDP setting the pace we hope other political parties will follow suit .” The Coordinator further said  picking Okowa ,who is a Christian and a minority Anioma in Delta State from the extraction of South-South geo-political zone, has no doubt  laid to rest the fears of political crisis. “Our greatest joy now is that the tension stirred up by Muslim -Muslim ticket rumours  in some quarters  can now be doused with the balanced alternative provided by  the PDP Presidential Candidate who is from  North and his  running from the South,” he stated. He however, averred that Governor Okowa ,who is a former lawmaker and current Delta Governor became the beautiful bride, because of overt  requisite leadership qualities that endeared Atiku to pick him as running mate. “Apparently ,his performance and ability to accommodate all residents regardless of ethnic or religious differences  must have been part of the reasons that favoured his choice ,’ he said. While urging the electorate to weigh the pros and cons of Atiku/Okowa as a united force for a united Nigeria , he appealed to all aggrieved persons, especially in the PDP  to sheath their swords and work with the party to ensure victory at the polls. “Afterall, Atiku chose  Okowa after a wide consultations with various stakeholders and party stalwarts,” he said.
