Vanguard gathered the incident occurred on Saturday night even as the destruction of crops is ongoing in some communities in the State. Although the security agencies did confirm the development Rwang Tengwong, the National Publicity Secretary of Berom Youth Moulders-Association, BYM said his organization which is a tribal body for the Beroms in the State is aware of the situation. Tengwong said, “At about 8:34 pm of last night, 4th June 2022, armed men suspected to be Fulani militias attacked Chaha village. As a result, 24 years old Stephen Gyang was reportedly killed while Isaac Gyang and Rev. Davou Ishaya John sustained varying degrees of injury, and are currently receiving medical attention in the Hospital… The militias ambushed the Pastor and Isaac Gyang who were coming back from a church program… “On hearing the cry for help from his elder brother, Isaac and Rev. Ishaya, Stephen Gyang went out to render assistance but met his untimely death from the numerous bullet shots riddled on him by the attackers who were still around the area. Isaac and the Reverend were taken to Vom Christian Hospital for medical attention. Due to the critical condition of Mr. Isaac Gyang, he has been referred to Jos University Teaching Hospital, JUTH for intensive medical attention.” On the destruction of crops, he added, “The Berom Youth Moulders-Association, BYM under the leadership of Solomon Dalyop Mwantiri, Esq is concerned about the serious destruction of farmlands and provocative grazing by Fulani marauders in parts of Jos South, Riyom, and Barkin Ladi Local Government Areas and the conspiracy of silence from relevant security agencies and government officials… “We also condemn the destruction of farmlands and provocative grazing by the Fulanis as this is another dimension of the genocide that the jihadists have docus on to ensure we die of hunger. As a people who are mostly farmers, we call on the government to show sincerity in addressing the issue of frequent killings by herders and the destruction of farmlands as we cannot continue to bury our loved ones and also fold our hands and watch the source of our livelihood been destroyed every day.” The BYM however sympathize with the family of the deceased and pray for the quick recovery of the injured and called on the youths in Vwang and the entire Berom land to remain calm and vigilant,  promising to use all the legal measures to ensure justice for our people and also call on spirited individuals to “support the families of both the deceased and the injured to give them hope and a sense of belonging.”
