The governorship candidate of All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, in Rivers State, Prince Ugo Beke, has called on the people of the state to participate in the ongoing Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Continuous Voters Registration (CVR) exercise.  Beke made the appeal  in a chat with newsmen.He said it’s important for those above 18 years who have not yet registered to endeavor to partake in the exercise.  Beke noted that those that want their voting points or unit and area changed, should grab the ongoing opportunity.He also urged them to endeavor to complete the process at designated centers from where they can obtain their Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) to avoid being disenfranchised.“I am optimistic that our party will emerge victorious in the next polls, while we continue to mobilize our supporters at the grassroots to participate in the exercise,” he added.
