However, we have a lot more to do. The APC project is far from over and we need all of you to come together to ensure our progressive journey to peace and prosperity is sustained. ‘‘Our candidate, His Excellency, Sen, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is no stranger to you. He is our friend and brother. We know his commitment, his track record, and his capacity to lead our party to success. “So now is the time for all of us to come together and march forward, as we did in 2015, to a convincing APC victory. ‘‘I look forward to working closely with APC Governors to support Sen.
