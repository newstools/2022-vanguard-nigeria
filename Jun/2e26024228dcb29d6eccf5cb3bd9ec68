Adebayo said: “The BVAS worked quite well. Of course, there are hitches here and there, which is expected of technology. “Maybe less than less than 1% of the BVAS equipment had problems as INEC officials were not in any malpractice; they didn’t forge any results. Whatever the people voted is what INEC recorded. “You can’t blame INEC if somebody collected money and voted. It’s not INEC’s job to go into the hearts of the people. “The locus of the crime has shifted from INEC to law enforcement agents and political parties. “There is no victim here because the voters voluntarily sold their votes. The victim is actually democracy.” Vanguard News
