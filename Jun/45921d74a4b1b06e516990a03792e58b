A mob has killed a member of a vigilance group in Lugbe area of Abuja for making a blasphemous statement. According to reports, the ugly incident occurred while members of the vigilance group at the popular Timber Shed market at the Federal Housing Estate (FHA) Lugbe in Abuja, were making moves to arrest some residents trespassing the market in the early hours of Saturday. The residents were said to have begged the vigilantes to free them in the name of Allah but one of the vigilantes kicked and made comments alleged to be blasphemous. It was gathered that one of the vigilante operatives insisted that even if “God comes down”, he will not release the person arrested to go home. The comment provoked the other group, which regrouped and brought down the vigilante office to rescue their man. The group reportedly attacked, killed, and set ablaze the vigilante personnel who insisted that he will not release the arrested person from detention. At the time this report was filed, security operatives have been deployed to the scene of the incident in order to calm down tension in the area and prevent reprisal attack.
