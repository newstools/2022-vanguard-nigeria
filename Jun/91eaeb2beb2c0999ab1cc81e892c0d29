I feel like artists are stuck and still struggling to break that international barrier for rap so we need that and I am that guy”, he said confidently.  Sharing what music means to him, Sleek who has been doing music for the past 12 years said: “music means everything to me, there’s literally a song out there for any mood you are in, I can’t go a day without listening to music”.Speaking on the growth of the Afrobeat genre, the international rapper said  “I love it so much cause we are showing the world ‘we no de carry last’ the whole world is watching us take over day by day, whether it is music, movies or food. Everyone listens to Afrobeat, all the American artists are now trying to mimic the sound but it doesn’t even sound as good, you can see the TikTok and Instagram reels, the world will rather dance to Afrobeat than anything else, Afrobeat just makes you feel all happy and good about yourself, even if you can’t dance you will move to the beat”, said Sleek.
