The group,in a statement signed  by Dr. Adelanke Oyintoke Peter on Saturday,said although the TCA is not biased towards any presidential aspirant contesting to be the presidential flagbearer of the APC, they however.owe the party and party members the need to guide its direction ahead of the National Convention of the party. According to the statement which was cautioned ‘OUR STAND!’, TCA explained that “partisan politics is not all about Pierre de Coubertin sports philosophy of participation in contests; it is all about winning.” “The Consolidation Ambassadors (TCA) with its firm foundation within 36 States of the Federation and FCT, emerged as worthy Ambassadors of the All Progress Congress (APC) who recognised and appreciated the progress made by President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR) led administration in the areas of Infrastructures, Human Capital Development, Agriculture, Anti-Corruption, Digital Economy Transformation and all inclusive governance.” “We resolved to identify and unify all political structures and supporters of the aspirants that contested or are contesting for elective posts under the umbrella of our great party, particularly the 23 Presidential Aspirants by providing the necessary support to the flagbearers after the primaries.” “Although, the TCA is not biased towards any presidential aspirant contesting to be the presidential flagbearer of our great party, however, we owe our party and party members the need to guide its direction towards fielding that candidate that will be able to outwit and defeat the Peoples Democratic Partys flagbearer at the 2023 presidential elections.” “It is for this reason, after due consultations and considerations, that we suggest that the party should field a candidate that can stand shoulder-to-shoulder, eye-ball-to-eye-ball, kobo-for-kobo, tactics-for-tactics, strategy-for-strategy, popularity-for-popularity and national-acceptance-for-national-acceptance; with the international recognition and respect. A candidate with national acceptability, who after winning can consolidate the legacies of President Muhammadu Buhari.” “Partisan politics is not all about Pierre de Coubertin sports philosophy of participation or mere contest, but it is all about WINNING! Hence, The Consolidation Ambassadors National Organizing Secretary Dr. M. S. Awwal with the support of other national executive members, unreservedly with all our strength and might declare our unflinching support for the national leader of our party; Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu.” “Our collective resolve to support Asiwaju Bola Tinubu emanates from the opposition People’s Democratic Party choice of their presidential candidate. It is a political development that needs careful analysis, consideration and realignment. Without any iota of doubt, Tinubu is APCS most influential politician. His mentoring of top politicians is legendary and his national acceptance is no doubt a nonnegotiable fact that can usher our party to success come 2023 election.” “In order to achieve our collective resolve to sustain, renew, unify, reinvigorate and to consolidate President Muhammadu Buhari legacies bequeathed to Nigeria and Nigerians, we call on all rank and file of All Progressive Party Members and indeed, all Nigerians to support Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu in the coming 2023 Presidential Elections.” “For Nigeria to consolidate on the achievements of President Buhari, we need a bold, frank, independent, transparent, intelligent, smart-thinker, creative mind and above all, a man of Tinubus experience, sterling  leadership qualities, a detribalised man, a man who treats everybody on equal, just and fairness, irrespective of religion, gender or age.” “A man with the immeasurable leadership qualities known for Nigerias Founding Fathers  Ahmadu Bello, Obafemi Awolowo, Nnamdi Azikiwe, and Tafawa Balewa. A man who can usher the country into a modern Nigeria  that man is ASIWAJU AHMED BOLA TINUBU!”
