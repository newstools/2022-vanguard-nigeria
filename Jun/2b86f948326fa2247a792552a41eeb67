The Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN), on Saturday, suspended Nollywood actor, Moses Armstrong indefinitely for allegedly defiling a 16-year-old girl. The actor was on Thursday, arrested by Akwa Ibom State Police Command following the rape allegation. The AGN Director of Communications, Monalisa Chinda, announced his suspension in a statement made available to newsmen on Saturday. Most Nollywood celebrities in the comment section of Chinda condemned this action allegedly perpetrated by Armstrong. Chinda while quoting Emeka Rollas, AGN President, stated that the indefinite suspension became necessary following an investigation by the guild on the rape allegation. Part of the statement read: “Actor Moses Armstrong has been placed on indefinite suspension by the National Executive Committee of the Actors Guild of Nigeria over his arrest by the police on allegation of raping a minor,” the statement read. “Armstrong’s suspension was based on facts emanating from the preliminary investigations conducted by the Guild on the allegation.” The AGN noted that in its advocacy against violation of women, the allegation against Moses Armstrong is capable of tarnishing its good image and reputation if urgent action is not taken in accordance with the constitutional provisions of the Guild. “The National President, Ejezie Emeka Rollas, said it is a sad development but nobody is above the law, especially on rape and abuse of women. “‘Though it is our duty to protect our members when it comes to serious allegations, the law will have to take its course,” the National President said. The statement further read that Armstrong, while on suspension, is not expected to participate in any film production or guild’s activities. The National/State Chapter Task Forces have also been directed to monitor all film locations and production sets in Nigeria as violation of the suspension rules may lead to further stiff disciplinary measures as stipulated by the AGN constitution.
