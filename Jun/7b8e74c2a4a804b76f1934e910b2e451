He added: “Preliminary investigation revealed that the child was chained by his stepmother, Mrs Victoria Nwosu, 26 years “The father of the three children, Mr Chimezie Nwosu, 30 years seeing his wife maltreating the child never showed concern or cautioned his wife. It was also discovered that the three rescued children were left by Mr Victor Nwosu’s estranged wife. “On rescuing the children, the police operatives immediately rushed them to a nearby government hospital where they were treated and discharged. “However, they were later handed over to a government-recognised orphanage where they will be well taken care of pending when their mother is located. “Meanwhile, the two suspects are presently in police custody undergoing interrogation and will be charged to court as soon as investigation is concluded.” Vanguard News
