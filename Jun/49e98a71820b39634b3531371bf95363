She stated this at the strategy meeting on part F of the Companies and Allied Matters Act, CAMA, with the theme: “The CAMA Shrinking our Square: A critical Dialogue,” in Abuja. This is even as she stated that the CAMA act is restrictive on NGOs and civil society organisations, adding that it is a collective responsibility of all bodies involved to effect a change. She said, “The CAMA being a very good law for the business sector, is very restrictive on civil society organisations, NGOs, mosques, churches and everybody incorporated as a non-profit organisation under the CAC.

This is about human life and coexistence as we know it. We are in a very dangerous spot. “The thing is power has left the President but it has not settled on anybody and so everybody has a responsibility at this particular time to queue together. We can disagree on who we vote for but what we cannot disagree on, is that we need a space in which to disagree. “Whether PDP, APC, Peter Obi, Kwankwaso, and a lot of them, let us at least agree that we need to protect  a Nigerian space in which those divergent manifestations can take place. Everyone, journalists, politicians, faith workers, teachers, in our little spaces let us exert influence to make sure that people behave properly and not further poison the environment, this is for me where we should begin from.” Vanguard News Nigeria
