Meanwhile, the Group Managing Director, African Natural Resources and Mines Limited, Alok Gupta, who was represented by Patrick Gush spoke on opportunities on Nigeria’s mining sector. Gupta said: “Nigeria is heavily endowed with solid minerals with 44 minerals found in over 500 locations including all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, have more than one mineral type which indeed is a rare occurrence. “With the view of maximizing these opportunities, to create wealth, grow the GDP and expand opportunities available to Nigerians. The mining sector is the backbone of industrialization of the economy. “He also pointed various incentives rolled out n the Buhari-led administration to promote ease of doing business in the sector. However, he said, “The mining implementation and stability is strategically focusing on steel. Nigeria has the 12th largest steel deposits in the world with more than 3 billion tonnes resources in Kogi, Enugu, Zamfara and Kaduna States. “Annually $3.3 billion is still spent on steel imports which impact the economy. With focusing on steel Nigeria can reduce dependency on imports and the economy would become a major player in global markets. He also disclosed that his company has established a fully integrated mining and steel processing plant in Kudini Village in Kadarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State, with 5 million tonnes per annum, which is Nigeria’s largest foreign direct investment of $600 million, and has employed over 4000 Nigerians, including good community development projects and schemes ongoing.
