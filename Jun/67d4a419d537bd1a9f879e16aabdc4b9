Before now, fairly used wears popularly known in Nigeria as Okrika, are usually patronized by the poor and are often sold on roadsides, streets and market shades. That is why it got several other derogatory appendages like second hand clothes, bend down select, and tokunbor wears,  among others. However, Economy&lifestyle has discovered that most classy women now go for first grade used clothes, instead of their usual all round Turkey and United Kingdom, UK, wears, due to the consistent rise in the prices of those brands. The average price of a top grade Turkey gown today ranges from N250,000 upwards, which is twice the old price. According to the Chairperson, National Council of Women Committee, Mrs. Amagu Oluchi, most classy women are now managing their lean resources by mixing a few Turkey gowns they can afford with fairly used clothes. She said: “I learnt that fairly used clothes have levels, like first grade and others. Sometimes one could get what has never been used at all. “Besides, it is generally believed that okrika is cheaper and of good quality compared to some brands of wears, especially those from the Asian countries. “For classy women who cannot afford many designers at a time, they resign to okrika.” Mrs Animashaun Victoria, a civil servant said: “As a person, I don’t like okrika because I always feel strangers who I don’t know their medical history have worn them. But now I have no other option than mixing it with other brands. I don’t do the buying from the shops but online. I just have to buy them to cut down expenses.” Meanwhile, the prices of Okrika were cheap enough for the poor to afford. But the state of the economy has beaten that history to death. The ‘second hand’ clothes, ‘bend down select’ or Okrika have also become expensive and unaffordable for the poor since the rich started patronising them. The roadside picking of okrika has improved and  now they are sold online. The price of a first grade okrika gown now ranges from N25, 000 upwards which was even twice its price as at N2015. Also, the price of tops which was as low as N3000  as at 2015 has risen to N25,000 and above. Testifying to this fact, Mrs Chiamaka Chukwuma,  a female dress seller in Katangowa market , Lagos lamented: “ The depreciation of the naira has seriously affected our business. The price of a bale of first grade female dress now goes for N200, 000 and above as against N50, 000 before. Depending on your luck, a bale may contain few clean wears that can help you recover your money. “ We look at the transportation cost and other levies before putting a price on each piece”.
