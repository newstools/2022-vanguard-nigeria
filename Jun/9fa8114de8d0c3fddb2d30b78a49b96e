By Biodun Busari Former Kaduna Senator, Shehu Sani has described River Sate Governor, Nyesom Wike as an asset to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Sani made the assertion on Thursday before Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa was appointed as the vice presidential candidate of PDP. Sani tweeted: “Okowa played a key role in the victory of Atiku at the primaries and he is a cross between the South-East and the South-South. Wike strongly emerged second, committed so much in sustaining the party and his ruggedness is an asset in the battle when it turns dirty. Any can be VP. Meanwhile, after PDP’s presidential flag bearer, Atiku Abubakar picked Okowa on Thursday as his running mate, Sani tweeted, “Congratulations to Okowa:An equitably balanced team.” Congratulations to Okowa:An equitably balanced team.
