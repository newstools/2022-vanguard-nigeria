Speaking to newsmen in Lagos last week, the Executive Secretary of the Council, Mr. Emmanuel Jime, said the agency has also commenced moves to stop the payment of the container deposit fee by Nigerian importers and their agents. Jime who described the payment and collection of container deposit fee as oppressive and short of being a fraud stated: “The Shippers’ Council takes this container deposit regime as presently operated as oppressive. I do not want to use the word fraudulent but that appears to me what it seems to be.
