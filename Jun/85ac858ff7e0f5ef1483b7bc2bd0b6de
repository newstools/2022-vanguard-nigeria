The father of the three children, Mr. Chimezie Nwosu ‘m’ age 30 years seeing his wife maltreating the child never showed concern or cautioned his wife. It was also discovered that, the three rescued children were left by Mr Victor Nwosu’s estranged wife.  “On rescuing the children, the police operatives immediately rushed them to a nearby government hospital were they were treated and discharged. However, they were later handed over to a government recognized Orphanage Home where they will be well taken care of, pending when their mother is located.” On what the Command has done to the perpetrators of the child abuse, the PPRO said: “The two suspects are presently in police custody undergoing interrogation and they will be charged to court as soon as investigation is concluded.” Vanguard News Nigeria
