Amadi, who stated this yesterday in Owerri, said: “Obi is the best candidate to turn Nigeria around for good. Nigeria is lying on its back like a fallen warrior and this is no time to delay in handing her to the right doctor for restoration. Continuing, Amadi described the exit of Obi from the PDP as the saddest day of his life. “I thought the PDP knows better and believes in the spirit of equity. I wonder if the party can muster the kind of political strength needed to push such a haven for misfits, bigoted and corrupt folks aside, for the good of Nigeria. Wherever Peter Obi is, that is where we are going to be. “What is wrong with the Igbo man playing the first fiddle in Nigeria? Are we strangers or slaves in a nation that our efforts have kept afloat despite the clear marginalization? We continue to win accolades and merits for Nigeria in every field of human endeavour”, he stated.
