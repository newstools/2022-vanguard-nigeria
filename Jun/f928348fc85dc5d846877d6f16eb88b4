By Emmanuel Okogba Wales booked one of the remaining spots left at this year’s FIFA World Cup in Qatar after a victory over a courageous Ukrainian side on Sunday in Cardiff. No Welsh team has made it to the finals since it held in 1958 in Sweden where they got to the quarter-finals and lost to eventual winners Brazil. It will be perfect way for Gareth Bale to end an international career that has lasted for close to two decades.  Also in their class is Aaron Ramsey who has few football career years left in his legs. Bale saw action for 83 minutes before he was replaced by Fulham winger, Harry Wilson. “It’s the greatest result in the history of Welsh football. We’re going to a World Cup! “Words can’t describe how we feel at the moment. “I’m just delighted we are going to a World Cup. It means everything, it’s what dreams are made of. I’m speechless. I’m so glad we’ve done it for these amazing fans.” Bale told Sky Sports after an Andriy Yarmolenko own-goal proved the difference. Bale’s contract with Real Madrid comes to an end this summer and the 32 years old will continue playing somewhere else next season. Wales will compete in Group B against England, Iran and the United States.
