In a recent tweet, the ‘General’, as he is fondly called by fans, revealed that he was not in a relationship, because he was scared of being in a relationship with somebody that has trust issues. Pere also tagged relationships as work. “Being in a relationship with someone who’s got trust issues is a lotta work. They always believe there’s someone else in the picture. You gotta always convince ‘em that the invisible other they think is there, is actually not there. Who wan pay for this kind of work?” Pere said. Pere may have tweeted this to take people’s mind away from the recent controversy he finds himself in. It will be recalled that a US-based journalist in a recent tweet, had allegedly stated that there was a gist around Abuja that Pere and the First Lady of Kogi state, Rashida Bello, were alleged lovers. “Why is #BBNaija Pere Egbi all over the place with Kogi First Lady, Rashida Bello? Gist around Abuja says that they are lovers. Egbi and Mrs Bello are said to have been sighted severally at the Hilton Hotel, Abuja. The gist is that when they first met, the First Lady gifted Egbi N5 million.” The journalist tweeted. Pere however defended himself, claiming Jackson’s tweet was a figment of imagination. “For the records, the publication about me and the First Lady of Kogi State is a demonic lie and a figment of a diseased imagination of Jackson Ode and those retweeting that rubbish, they must answer me in court both in Nigeria and in the United States of America where he is based.” Pere fired
