It particularly frowned on the inclusion of its convener, Sen Julius Ucha, by a group, APC South-East Front, in the list of those drumming support for Sen Ahmed Lawan. In a statement by Messrs Leonard Nworie and Gilbert Utobo, SEM, said the inclusion of Ucha came at a time when he was protesting the allocation of votes in a parallel All Progressives Congress,APC, governorship primary in Ebonyi State. The statement reads: “Tongues have started wagging in Southeast following the attempt by some politicians to position themselves as a support group for the Presidential ambition of Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan. “A group,  APC South-East Front, inadvertently included the name of Senator Julius Ali Ucha, the convener of South East Mandate (SEM). “Members of South East Mandate, who noticed the name of their convener, started making enquiries only to find out that the group was in a hurry to position themselves as the arrowhead of campaigns for Senator Lawan to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari.   “The politicians did not affix signatures of the prominent members of Southeast APC whom they included their names.’’ “The inclusion of the name of Senator Julius Ali Ucha came at a time when the former Chairman, Senate Committee on Works was protesting the allocation of votes in a parallel APC governorship primary in Ebonyi State, which he did not attend or subscribe to.
