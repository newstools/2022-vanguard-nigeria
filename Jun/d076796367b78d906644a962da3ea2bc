Over 50 people were killed and several injured when unknown armed men stormed the church, detonated bombs and opened fire on the congregation at the same time. The killers, four in number, were reported to have arrived the premises of the church around 11.30 am in Volkswagen Gulf vehicle, disguised into the church as worshippers and moved in with the members before detonated the bombs. Reacting to the attack, Adebayo said: “It is with deepest sadness that I heard of the killings at the Catholic church in Owo, Ondo state. Wanton destruction of lives, peace and sanctity in the sanctuary of faith by evil forces is a stain on the conscience of Nigeria and final whistle against complacency. Government must act.”
