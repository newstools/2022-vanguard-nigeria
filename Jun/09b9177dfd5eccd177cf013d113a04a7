Oyebanji polled a total of 187, 057 votes to win the election, and was declared winner by Prof. Oyebode Adebowale, the INEC returning officer, having certified the requirements of the law. Oyebanji defeated his closest contender and former governor of Ekiti, Segun Oni of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) candidate, who scored 82, 211, to come second. At the end of collation of total votes, Oyebanji won his opponents in 15 of the 16 local government areas of the state, an unarguably 94 per cent of the state by majority, while Kolawole of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP won in only one local government, which is Efon Alaye LG. Against the above background Vanguard seeks to bring to consciousness some few notable things to know about the Ekiti governor-elect,as well as some political peculiarities of the State in its history governorship elections. New Record: With his landslide victory at the just concluded governoship election,  Oyebanji has set a new record  in  the political and electoral history of Ekiti state. Since inception of the State, it was the first time an incumbent governor would  produce a successor from the same party. From the get-go, Oyebanji, the candidate of the APC leveraged on the strength of incumbent and support of governor, Kayode Fayemi whose second tenure will be coming to an end in few months. Oyebanji also enjoyed the support of the APC presidential candidate in the 2023 general election, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.  Similarly,  Oyebanji’s victory marks the first time a political party will record a back-to-back victory in governorship in the state. The first governor to make the attempt in 2003 and first civilian governor of the state, Niyi Adebayo, of the defunct Alliance for Democracy (AD) failed  to win his re-election. Adebayo was knocked down and thrown out of office by the candidate of the People’s DemocraticParty PDP, Ayo Fayose.  A phenomenal Fayose, was consequently impeached over allegations of corruption and was made to exile Ekiti State in circumstances best described as controversial. Past court litigations:But, in 2007, Segun Oni, who was then the  candidate of the PDP, won governorship election. Oni’s victory was sternly challenged in the courts by Kayode Fayemi, the candidate of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN). The court later declared Fayemi winner of the election and was sworn in in 2010 after conducting a re-run election in Ido-Osi local government area. Seeking his reelection bid in 2014, Fayemi, however, lost his second term election  Fayose, the candidate of the PDP.  Incredibly, Fayose won in all the 16 local governments of the state in the election, but not without allegations of voter suppression and intimidation of opposition elements, among other electoral irregularities. In 2018, Fayemi stated a come-back, after serving as a minister in the cabinet of President Muhammadu Buhari. He defeated the candidate of the PDP, then deputy governor to Fayose, Olusola Eleka. His come-back scuttled  the PDP’s attempt of winning a back-to-back Ekiti gubernatorial election.  Who is the Ekiti Governor-elect: Biodun Oyebanji? The Ekiti governor-elect, Oyebanji is the immediate past Secretary to the State Government (SSG). had previously served in the first tenure of Mr Fayemi, from 2010 to 2014, traversing a couple of ministries as commissioner.

He had previously served as a special assistant to the pioneer civilian governor of the state, Niyi Adebayo, on parliamentary affairs before his appointment as a special adviser.He later served as the Chief of Staff to the governor in the concluding part of the administration.

Political analysts also said he has a deep understanding of the issues of governance and development confronting Ekiti.
