The Ogun State Government has made clarifications that Governor Dapo Abiodun did not issue any statement in response to the outburst of the National Leader and presidential aspirant of All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu. Recall Tinubu who recently visited party delegates in Ogun state jabbed the governor saying “this one (Abiodun) wouldn’t have become governor if I had not backed him?” On Friday morning, a statement posted on Abiodun’s social media page, wherein the governor said he is not an emperor, stressing that the governorship office he occupies is also not his family inheritance was widely reported in the media as a veiled message targeted at his estranged godfather (Tinubu). However, in a press statement released on Friday night signed by Abdulwaheed Odusile, the Ogun State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, the government said Governor Abiodun’s post ‘was an extract to re-emphasise his comments to party faithful and appointees on May 29 during the celebration of his third year in office, which also coincided with his 62nd birthday’. The statement reads: “The attention of the Ogun State Government has been drawn to comments purportedly made by Governor Dapo Abiodun in reaction to statements made by the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and presidential hopeful, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, during his recent visit to party delegates in the state. “For the avoidance of doubt, the tweet released this morning was an extract to re-emphasize the comments of Governor Abiodun to party faithful and appointees on May 29 during the celebration of his third year in office, which also coincided with his 62nd birthday. “The comments could, therefore, not have been a response to comments by Asiwaju Tinubu whose visits to Abeokuta came five days later. “While Governor Abiodun appreciates the media, including online platforms, as partners in progress with Government, he enjoins media practitioners to always report the truth at all times and refrain from giving vent to fake news, distortions, and misinterpretations.
