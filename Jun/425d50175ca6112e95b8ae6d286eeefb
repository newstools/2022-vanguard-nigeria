The Head of the Energy Committee of the Egypt-African Businessmen’s Committee,  Engr. Hussein Ghazzawy, flayed the countries on the continent for their lack of vision. He said, “Africa produces a large quantity of oil but imports petroleum products at between 4-5 times the value of the oil so exported.  How can you do that? “When you export your crude oil and then import refined petroleum products,  you are exporting jobs to other regions. You are exporting your opportunities and wealth to others, at the detriment of your people.” On electricity,  he regretted that despite the abundance of Hydropower resources,  gas and renewable energy sources like sun and wind, the region had the worst energy record of a mere 3 per cent of global electricity power supply. He regretted that 580 million of  Africa’s population of about 1.4 billion had no electricity. According Engr. Ghazzawy, “We will not  progress without affordable and sustainable energy.  We need to fully utilise our hydropower and resources.  We need to accelerate renewable- solar and wind.” “I hate to hear when I enter a shop and I am told,  “This is imported product.  Buy it.’ “Let us believe in ourselves.  Let us stop exporting our raw materials and then turn round to import finished products.” In her contributions, the Senior Advisor, Private Sector Engagement,  AfCFTA Secretariat, Ms. Cynthia Gnassingb-Essonam, urged Africa to produce more than it was consuming. She noted that Africa was contributing a mere 3 per cent to the global economy, and  that the narrative must change, as according to her, Singapore, a small country was contributing 6 per cent to global economy. She identified four major sectors with huge gaps that needed immediate investments on the continent, namely , automobile,  logistics,  pharmaceuticals and agriculture.
