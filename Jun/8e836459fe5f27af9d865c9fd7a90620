The film, a biopic on former President Ibrahim Babangida, whose release has been institutionally hindered since 2019, is a dramatic vista through which history and political watchers can belter understand the events that dogged the years of General Babangida in Nigeria’s political scene lasting over 4 decades. Directed and produced by award-winning filmmaker, Obi Emelonye whose directorial skills revolutionised Nollywood with blockbusters like ‘Last Flight To Abuja’, ‘Mirror Boy’ and ‘Oxford Gardens’, the film has a stellar cast led by Enyinna Nwigwe, alongside actors like: Yakubu Mohammed, Julius Agwu, Charles Inojie, Kalu Ikeagwu, Okey Bakassi, Anthony Monjaro and Ali Nuhu amongst others. In his Democracy Day post, the Emelonye wrote: “June 12. Every chemical reaction needs a catalyst. Every fight needs an instigator. Every chaos needs a spanner. Once the quorum is reached for the communion of spirits, someone is required to extinguish the torch. ABN- Association for Better Nigeria was a lot of things to many people, but it sowed the seed of discord which blossomed into the sheer anarchy of June 12. BADAMASI is boldly naming names on Amazon Prime.”
