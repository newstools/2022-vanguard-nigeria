By Abdulmumin Murtala Kano—A 20-year-old construction worker, Abdulkadir Nasiru, lost his life while his co-worker, Naziru Shafiu, sustained injuries as a three-storey building collapsed in Kanti Kwari textile market in Kano State, yesterday. Two of the three floors of the building have been completed while the third floor is under construction when it collapsed around 12:35 pm. An eyewitness, who preferred not to be mentioned, said a lot of buildings in the market do not conform to professional standards. He noted that people indiscriminately add extra floors to their buildings without professional advice. Confirming the incident to Vanguard, spokesperson of the Kano State Fire Service, Saminu Yusif, attributed the cause of the incident to the use of substandard building materials.
