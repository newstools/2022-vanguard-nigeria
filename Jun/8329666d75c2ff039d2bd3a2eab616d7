In a video posted on her verified Instagram page, the school’s Chancellor, Donrnett Mcintosh Ph.D, announced her induction as the Head of the Department of Arts, Music and Entertainment.  However, in a chat, the comedienne noted how she was elevated to the position. According to Professor Paul, it helps when one is actively engaged in both practical and theoretical works in a university and society at large. Professor Paul said: “Whatever you do in your field of work would help in your career growth. For instance, Nike Art Gallery, a beautiful woman who is one of my mentors, her talent speaks for her both home and abroad to the extent of her getting recognised in universities not just in Nigeria but globally. “Also, I learnt that Prof. Lamidi Fakeye of Michigan University, USA, got promoted by his artistic works (wood structure) at the Institute of African Studies, Obafemi Awolowo University in the 1980s. This shows that talent works as well.” More so, the thespian stated that bagging a PhD three years ago at the University of Lagos was a plus for her as she describes herself as ‘a true representation of Town and Gown’. She said, “First, professorial positions are about what experiences you have had and your PhD as long as you are actively engaged in a University consistently. “So, it is not really about furthering studies, rather, it is about being promoted due to one’s contributions and pedigree to scholarship and humanity in general. “In addition, the degree I bagged in the prestigious University of Lagos, Nigeria being my PhD is the key to my being relevant in a university or academic circle. I have for a while been actively involved with teachings and affiliative partnerships with universities across the globe using entertainment as a tool. Also, many of my performances are case studies for my research works.” Elated about her new status, Professor Paul said:”Sincerely, I feel very humbled and pray to have the energy, tenacity and capacity to fit into the huge tasks ahead..”
