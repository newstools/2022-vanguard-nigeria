The Director of the board, Malam Nasiru Danmallam, who made this known in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja, said the camping was to prepare the intending pilgrims for their transportation to Saudi Arabia. Danmallam had requested those in the first flight to report on Thursday (yesterday) from 10a.m. for the collection of their travel documents and other preparations for their transportation, in preparation for airlifting today, stating: “the first flight of FCT intending pilgrims was scheduled to take off Friday.” The director explained that all intending pilgrims would be subjected to a mandatory PCR test, in line with the guidelines for 2022 Hajj by Saudi Arabian authority, before they are airlifted. He, therefore, advised all intending pilgrims to abide by the laid down regulations. He disclosed that the intending pilgrims should check for their flight schedules at the head office of the board in the Central Area, or at the permanent Hajj camp to know their schedules. He said the board had taken measures to ensure compliance of all guidelines for the exercise and it had started receiving visas for FCT 2022 intending pilgrims, while arrangements for the Basic Travel Allowance (BTA) had been concluded.
