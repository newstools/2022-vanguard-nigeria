These consultations, according to him,  “must be deepened and the policy frame work and engagement of the APC standard bearer must be broad having the capacity to cut through all the divides in the country.” “Certainly the coalition that will  produce victory at the general election is different from  the one that gave victory at the primaries,” he said . He noted that ” in the last forty eight  hours, the APC Presidential candidate has visited President Buhari, the Party Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and fellow contestants like Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi, and Governor Dave Umahi  of Ebonyi State among others.” Olawepo-Hashim who was a former Presidential  Candidate in the 2019 General elections also congratulated “all those who participated in the exercise especially Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi for a good impact; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for a robust campaign that raised hope; Senate President Ahmed Lawan for a great showing within two weeks of joining the contest.” “Also I must not fail to mention the youthful Governor of Kogi state who brought a lot of energy to the contest and all others who competed,” he said. He equally saluted what he described as “the hard work of our National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu and the entire party leadership for a well organised convention. Mr. President, Muhammadu  Buhari (GCFR), also deserves our felicitations for being a father to all .We thank God almighty for a great  convention.” According to him, “now is time to unite the party  and face together the huge challenge  to win again, the road is sure going to be rough and tough  but it is a task that is doable.”
