While fielding questions on a variety of topics on the relevance of theological institutions to the next generation, the rector asserted that the family today could survive the recent unfortunate circumstance that we as a people have come to find ourselves. A situation where couples including Christians descend into the malaise of domestic violence leading to the loss of lives could be avoided if critical attention will be accorded the admonition of Apostle Paul who pointed out that it is an observable end time’s occurrence. The Scripture in II Timothy 3:1-5 states; “in the end time, people will be boastful, unforgiving, and rash and all forms of ungodliness”. He added that there is a need for caution on the part of the would-be couples to be sure about the salvation of their partners and prepare very well for the subsequent marital life. He says that many people only prepare for the wedding day, and not marriage, emphasising that the need for pre-marital counseling as a means of understanding many knotty issues of marriage and planning for it with the help of the Holy Spirit. He says: “I discovered that our society today is quick to proffer solutions without investigating the origin of the problem. God is the author of marriage; the oldest institution in the world. Since God is not the author of confusion, He could not have instituted marriage if it will become a means of death. “Yes, you can be sure that GOD will not have instituted it and then go ahead to pronounce a blessing on the relationship,” Dr. Odesola encouraged church pastors, and other ministers of God to be more alive to their responsibilities of teaching what he called ‘necessary truths’ that build homes through the instrumentalities of couples’ fellowship as well as encouraging people to be more open to counseling when facing intimidations in their marriage. Birthday: Is it a happy day for Christians? ALL the disciples of Jesus and the saints of God in the early church never celebrated the day of birth. Even Jesus Christ, who was not born in sin, commanded that His disciples should only remember the day He died for the sins of mankind by observing the ordinance of the Lord’s Supper as written in 1 Corinthians 11:26: “For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord’s death till He come.” The day, the month and the year of the birth of Christ is not mentioned in the scripture. But, Satan, who is a deceiver of the whole world, has deceived all believers in Christ to celebrate “Christ-mas”, as the day of Christ’s birth which does not exist in the bible. Christ-mas is therefore, the celebration of ANOTHER JESUS, which Paul spoke about in 11 Corinthians 11:4: “For if he that cometh preacheth ANOTHER JESUS, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.” The only two birthdays recorded in the bible which sadly ended up in the death of two people, were celebrated by two ungodly kings, king Pharaoh and king Herod, as written in Genesis 40:20,22: “And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. But he hanged the chief baker.” And in Matthew 14:6,10, it is written: “But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod. And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.” This means that the devil, who had been a murderer from the beginning as written in John 8:44, is behind all birth-day celebrations! In Galatians 4:9-10, it is again written: “But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? Ye observe days, and months and times, and years.” This means that, any believer in Christ who observes the day of birth by celebrating it, comes again under bondage of weak and beggarly elements. If there be any day to be remembered, it should be the day one repented of his/her sin and became born again of the word of truth and of the Spirit of Christ. This should be the happiest day for all Christians, because the day of repentance of any sinner is the day of joy in heaven, as spoken by Jesus in Luke 15:10: “Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.” The day of the new birth in Christ is a day to always remember and rejoice over, because it is the day one’s name is written in heaven, as Jesus said in Luke 10:20b: “But rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.” To be continued! •Christian Gospel Church (The Truth Centre), 4 Christian Gospel Avenue, Beside Psychiatric Hospital, Uselu, Benin City, Edo State Email:cgc.com.ng@gmail.com Telephone: +234(0) 7052061135, +234(0)9030731406
