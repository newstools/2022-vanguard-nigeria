Unknown gunmen, Friday morning allegedly killed yet-to-be-identified police personnel attached to Nsukka Police Division at a checkpoint located at Umeano Junction, Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State. The unknown gunmen equally proceeded to another police checkpoint at Ibagwa-Ani, also in Nsukka Local Government Area where they set police patrol vehicles ablaze. Residents who spoke to Saturday Vanguard on the incident at Umeano Junction said the police officer was shot at about 6:30 am when he and his colleagues were checking traders going to a popular local market, Nkwo Ibagwa, located at the heart of Igbo-Eze South Local Government Area of the state. “It was around 6:30 am that we noticed some hooded gunmen who came in a vehicle, attacking policemen at a checkpoint here. The gunmen knocked the deceased policeman down with their vehicle. When his colleagues noticed what was going on, they ran away, abandoning him. It was at that point that the hooded gunmen shot the policeman dead before leaving the scene,” a resident who pleaded for anonymity told Saturday Vanguard. Confirming the incident, the spokesperson for the Enugu State Police Command, Daniel Ndukwe, said that the operatives of the Command were attacked, though he said that the details were still sketchy. “Yes, there was an attack on Police Operatives. But the details are still sketchy. I will communicate with you once I get details, please,” he said.
