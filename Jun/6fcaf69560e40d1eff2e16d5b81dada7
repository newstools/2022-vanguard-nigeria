A news blog had in an attempt to narrate how NSCDC personnel arrested a suspected vote buyer with exhibits, reported in its headline that the Corps had ‘hijacked’ the said money. However, Mr Odumosu said the Corps through its personnel performed its legitimate duties in collaboration with other security agencies and critical stakeholders in line with clearly spelt electoral guidelines without violating any of it. He said; “The two suspects were apprehended after the attention of NSCDC election monitoring team was drawn by the people, mostly party agents, to a chaotic situation created by some individuals allegedly attempting to disrupt the peaceful conduct of the election through vote buying and attack on voters by rented thugs. “The timely intervention of the Corps restored normalcy to the polling units. However, only a sum of six thousand thousand, seven hundred and twenty naira (N6,720) was found on the suspected vote buyer after a thorough search was conducted on her. “In spite of that, a preliminary investigation commenced on the suspects who were later released in order not to disenfrachise them after being accredited to vote as no incriminating materials were found on them. “To this end, the Corps wishes to state categorically, that, there was no collection or hijacking of any money belonging to any political party, their agents or any individual at Ikere-Ekiti Local Government. “The report is false, frivolous and perhaps a figment of imagination of the writer in an attempt to cast aspersion on the image and credibility of the Corps. “Members of the public are therefore urged to disregard and ignore such a mischievous report. *In an attempt to avoid such allegations and curb vote buying at polling units, the Corps’ delegation headed by Acting Deputy Commandant General Operations, Haruna Lawal Muhammed alongside other top officers embarked on election patrol. *On patrol, the team received reports of vote buying at wards within Ado- Ekiti and Ikire and was able to disperse such crowds. “The NSCDC is a noble organization with credibility and professional orientation, hence, its personnel cannot be moved by any monetary inducement, rather, they would report and return such illicit money to the authority if such a situation had arisen as they have done in other past elections in the country”, he added. Meanwhile, Commandant General of the NSCDC, Dr Ahmed Abubakar Audi, has congratulated all personnel who took part in the election for an impressive outing in Ekiti state, charging them to continue to be good ambassadors of the Corps wherever they find themselves on any national assignment. He however assured all personnel of the Corps’ commitment to ensuring that the benefits due to each operative are sorted out in due time.
