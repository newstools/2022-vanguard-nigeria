Mamman, who is fondly known as ‘Idris Durkwa’, had recently aspired on the platform of the APC in the 2022 Southern Borno Senatorial Primary of the APC, which he alleged that ‘the whole exercise was a charade, characterized by electoral irregularities and imposition that favoured incumbent senator Mohammed Ali Ndume as preferred Candidate’.  The defected APC Chieftain was a gubernatorial Aspirant in 2018 APC primaries that produced Professor Babagana Zulum as Governor in 2019 after emerged as Candidate. Durkwa claimed that, lack of respect and non-compliance with the 2022 Electoral Act Provisions by the Powers-That -Be within the Borno State APC, which culminated into a shady and dictatorial tendencies during the just concluded House of Assembly and Senatorial Primaries, particularly what played out in Southern Borno Senatorial District, where many delegates as well as teaming APC supporters were disenfranchised from exercising their democratic participation in the whole exercise, informed some parts of the reasons for his defection to the PDP.  More so, he stressed that, contrary to the Electoral Act 2022 Provisions, where the party is to hold a Special Congress in the Senatorial District with Delegates voting for Aspirants of their choice in a designated centre, Durkwa alleged that the exercise were perpetuated to be held separately in each of the nine (9) local government areas under the full supervision of officials appointed by the Borno State Government with high degree of impunity without the presence of the electoral committee, which according to him, these unwholesome developments have impede on the 2022 Electoral Act Provisions. He equally cited that the political narratives in Southern Borno Senatorial District need urgent change for people of the constituency feel the dividends of democracy at the centre.  Speaking to Vanguard at the week end on why he decided to opt out from APC, the party which he has contributed immensely for its development, Durkwa said, “as a democrat, a time has come for me and my teaming supporters to join forces with the major opposition party (PDP) which is determined to wrest power come 2023, especially in southern Borno Senatorial District. Majority of our people in the constituency are glaringly clamouring for change, in view of the poor representation by their Lawmaker at the national assembly in the past decade, and that is what informed my decision.  “I had the privileges and also had an interface with many people from the nine (9) local government areas that constituted Southern Borno Senatorial District, especially during my tour and consultations with delegates, stakeholders and teaming APC members. Unfortunately, I have seen the shedding tears on their faces as a result of lack of quality education, healthcare, decay in social infrastructures such as lack of boreholes, electricity, and the increasing poverty and joblessness amongst youths and the women folk. All these can be attributed to lack of proper representation by good leaders. Infact these narratives have to be change.” Durkwa lamented. He therefore revealed that he defected from a ‘sinking APC’, and has since been issued with his PDP membership Card with registration number: 012 and INEC -Voters’ Indentity Number, VIN: A25622408 in Shaffa Ward, Hawul Local Government Area of the state, that was duly signed by the Chairmen and Secretaries at his respective Ward, Local Government, State and National level. “I have formally come to pay my respect to the PDP which is the only opposition party to beat come 2023 general elections. I didn’t join the PDP alone, but I moved in with all my teaming supporters across the 27 local government areas of Borno state. “I and my teaming supporters are going to contribute in our maximum way to ensure that the our Presidential Candidate, the former Vice President of Nigeria, (GCON), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and indeed all our candidates vying for various political positions on the platform of our great party win with unprecedented victory come 2023. “I want to use this opportunity to thank all my teaming supporters who have also joined the promising and the unstoppable train, in continuation of their unflinching/maximum support and cooperation to ensure we all reach the promised land.” He stated.  ………Assassination attempt on his convoy He also recall about the ambush laid on his convoy along Maiduguri-Damaturu road by yet to be identified gunmen, where two policemen were killed with others injured, after setting ablaze one of vehicles in the convoy. His words: “As I prepared to set in motion, and mobilized my teaming supporters, political associates and friends for the campaign proper prior to the day of the primaries, an assassination attempt was laid on my entourage on Sunday, 22nd May, 2022 at about 9am by yet to be identified gunmen who laid ambush on us along Maiduguri- Damaturu road, in between Jakana and Mainok villages. “In that ambush, two policemen in the entourage were gunned down on the spot, with several others sustained gunshot injuries. Besides, my personal vehicle was shattered with bullets, after setting ablaze one of the vehicles. Although, these killers are yet to be fished out by security agencies, I thank God and prayed for the repose of the souls of the deceased police officers, and May Allah comfort their families.” Durkwa stated. He however said, with these and more of the unwholesome happenings and the gang up against his political ambition to liberate his people, triggered his decision to withdraw his membership from the APC and now pick tent with the main opposition PDP.
