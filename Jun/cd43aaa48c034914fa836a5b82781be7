The actress, known for her role in the popular sitcom, The Johnsons’’ had cried out in a short video she posted on her Instagram page that the issue is gradually taking her life but she believed that she would not die and would get over it. The actress, who lost her only child, Aladi Godgift in 2020, further stated that she has been dragged to court over her inability to deliver on a job because of her health condition. “Everything is going to be fine, I have an issue right now and it’s taking my life. I no go die, we will get over it. “I was given a job, I didn’t do the job because I had mental issues. Will people understand? They are slamming me with a bill, suing me. It’s okay,” the actress said in the viral video. According to Ameh, the company was suing her for a staggering amount, which she seems unable to afford. However, when our reporter contacted her on the telephone, the Benue State-born actress said “Everything is going to be alright.” Attempts to get her to speak further on the matter proved abortive, as she consistently refused to pick or return her calls. Meanwhile, some of her colleagues have been sending words of encouragement to her on Instagram. Leading the pack was actress Joyce Kalu, who assured Ameh that the storm would soon be over. “This storm will pass. God gat you,”she wrote. Just as actress Georgina Onuoha wrote, “Hang in there Ene. All will be well.” Also, Susan Peters wrote “This too shall pass.”
