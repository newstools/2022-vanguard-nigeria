Ronaldo’s future was up in the air following United’s failure to qualify for the Champions League, but the 37-year-old has hinted at his plans to stay next season, although he knows that there has to be a lot of change at the club. “I know he did a fantastic job for Ajax and that he’s an experienced coach but we need to give him time and things need to change the way he wants,” Cristiano said in a video released by United. “I hope he has success of course because if he succeeds, the whole club success as well. So I wish him the best.”
