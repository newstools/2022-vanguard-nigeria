To qualify for the recruitment, applicants must be indigenes of Anambra State and would have their NYSC discharge certificate, among other requirements. The applicants, mostly women, with many of them carrying babies, said the site did not open within the one hour duration of the exercise in most places. According to them, the site crashed as the 11 am time for the commencement of the examination approached. But the state Commissioner for Education, Professor Ngozi Udeh said over 6000 applicants submitted their papers successfully, adding that she would submit the report to Governor Chukwuma Soludo for the next line of action. About  40,000 people had applied for the recruitment as teachers as promised by Governor Soludo during his revised budget presentation and about 30000 were shortlisted for the 5000 vacant positions. Most of the applicants arrived at the Cyber cafe as early as 7 am, but were disappointed that the site could not open. Less than 30 minutes to the end of the examination, there were shouts by the applicants that the site had opened, thus causing pandemonium in most of the centers. Those who tried to log in with their phones said it was difficult, while some said the site was not steady with network. A particular woman had to call a relation in the United Kingdom to assist her in logging in because it was difficult for her to do so from Awka. It was gathered that there would be a second test for those who would be shortlisted after yesterday’s exercise.
