She promised to work with other stakeholders to reduce cargo dwell time at the port and assured the stakeholders of sustained communication and engagement to make the ports more productive. She stated: “The maritime industry is a major engine room in our national economy and as such, we must ensure that infrastructure is adequate and that there’s synergy across the industry while providing access to all our stakeholders. “The enterprise architecture we plan on implementing will ensure that the communication is dynamic and not stagnant and integrate into the ministry’s plan.
