By Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja The Chief Whip of the 9th Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, last night, said that the National Working Committee, NWC of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC will present Senator Ahmed Lawan to President Muhammadu Buhari as President candidate of the party for his endorsement. Orji who has since thrown his weight behind the aspiration of Lawan said that APC national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu made the right decision by chosing the Senate President as the consensus candidate of the party. Recall that Adamu Monday evening announced Lawan as the consensus candidate of the party for the 2023 presidential contest. The endorsement was however seen as a unilateral decision and against the support of the members of the NWC and APC governors who had asked that the presidential ticket be zoned to the southern part of the country. But reacting on his Facebook page last night, Kalu said the NWC will present Lawan for Buhari’s endorsement.  “Sen. Abdulahi Adamu, has through a vigorous evaluation of all our able and qualified candidates, decided in the interest of our party and the future wellbeing of millions of Nigerians who look to our party for continuous leadership,  decided that Senator Ahmed  Lawan is the strongest and most suitable candidate to be the flag bearer of our party in the upcoming Presidential election.  “The National Chairman and NWC of our party will present Senator Ahmed  Lawan to the President  of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for his endorsement”, he said
