This was part of the communique from.a 2 day interactive session on the 2023 Presidential Election by the Nigerian Youth Collective Action held in Kaduna between June 2nd and 3rd June, 2022. Aliyu Muhammad Sani, Director of Communications of the Nigerian Youth Collective Action, said at a press conference in Kaduna on Friday that  rsing from a Two-Day Interactive Session of the Nigerian Youth Collective Action, participants, speakers, discussants and delegates reached a consensus on deepening social, political and economic participation of the young people through inclusion and deliberate mainstreaming, and most importantly, creating opportunities for young people, in the coming 2023 Presidential election, in line with the Not Too Young to Run Law, of the country. He said the session recognized that Nigeria is a country with more than 70% of its population below the age of 50 years. And that the youthfulness fuels a huge energy capable of delivering sustainable prosperity to the over 200 million Nigerians if well harnessed and rightly targeted. “Consequently, in actually promoting the principles of the, Not Too Young to Run Law and the need to promote upward mobility of young people in all the spheres of leadership in our country. Key decisions were taken at the session.” “Resolutions and Submissions for Mainstreaming the Young Progressives on the strength of various submissions and articulations were made at the Conference, below are some of the resolutions and recommendations reached:” ” That the whole essence of the Not Too Young to Run agitation and the successful passage of the Bill into law was to have a generational leadership change and we applaud the commitment of the President Buharis administration, in this regard.” ” That the prohibitive costs of nomination Forms and the current practice of making very old people presidential candidates of political Parties is a direct assault on the Not Too Young To Run Act and block the opportunities for young people.” “That as Northern Youths, we condemn in strong terms, the failure of some political parties to follow the demands of Nigerian Youths, for a generational shift in leadership and their subsequent selection of Old Candidates, some close to 80 years old, for the next Presidential election.” “That Northern Nigerian Youths will ignore, avoid, and not vote political Parties that field candidates that are above 55 years of age as their Presidential candidates.” “That one of the major things causing problems in this country today, is because many old people are in charge of our national affairs who are not in tune with the current global governance practices, hence, the need for a young generation of leaders, come 2023.” “Northern Nigerian youths shall mobilise for, support and vote Parties that field only young candidates especially presidential candidates.That we have decided to say No! to old candidates and to support young candidates.” “Therefore, today, we launch our #NoToAncestorPresident and #WeDemandYoungPresident political movement towards the 2023 Presidential election.That, it is needful to deepen participation, by deliberately mainstreaming young people in government, for the purpose of ensuring the prosperity of our nation.” “May I solidly emphasize that, Northern youths will only vote a young presidential candidate, hence, any political Party that fields old presidential candidates will lose Northern Youths votes.Finally, we urge Northern Nigerian Youths, to remain steadfast in our renewed commitment, towards ensuring that there is a generational power shift in our country, come 2023,” he said.
