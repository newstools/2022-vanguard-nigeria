One of the survivors of Sunday’s attack at the St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State, John Nwogwu, said he was bombed after running to the altar for refuge. Nwogu spoke to Vanguard during an interview on his sick bed at the Federal Medical Centre in Owo, Ondo State. “What happened was that we were in the church after the last blessing and prayer by the Rev Father.“We just heard gunshots at the entrance of the church and before we know it, they started shooting and killing people. “Before we could knew what is going on, we had been surrounded and we had to hide at the back of the altar. “We heard a loud explosion and the ceiling fell on us. Even at that, they were still shooting at us and at the door of the place we are hiding. “I crawled to the altar only to be bombed there by the bandits. But thank God my life was preserved. “I saw one of our choir masters, he was hit by a bullet on the hip and was too tired. I can’t even speak about his condition because he was so weak when we left the church. “From where I was hiding, I was able to see one of the attackers. He was putting on Khaki that looked like that of Man o’ War. “God is the one who kept us alive.” Vanguard News
