Mr. Manji Yarling, Ag.

The Director said that the project was very important to the nation, as it would curb capital flight, create over 920 jobs and will also be a thing of pride for the nation to produce its own uniforms. He added that, with time, the DICON-Sur joint venture was expected to source all its raw materials from within Nigeria, in order to save theforeign exchange currently spent on the importation of the uniforms .  His words, “The fact that we produce our military and paramilitary uniforms locally is a pride to all of us. It is a pride that we all must uphold.“Sudan is producing their own military kits and I know DICON can do it if they have the right support.”He assured all stakeholders that the ICRC,  as part of its regulatory function would liaise with all the relevant government agencies to fast-track the on-going process of securing approval for off takers when production begins in January. According to  him, the ICRC, through its Contract Compliance Department (CCD), would make the DICON-Sure Project a priority until completion. Speaking at the interactive meeting, the Managing Director of Sur,  Mr. Burhan Can Karabulut, commended the management of ICRC for intervening and ensuring that the project was hitch-free. He said that the company had so far taken the project to 68 per cent completion and  that the remaining funds for the project would be released soon so as to meet the completion goal.“If the work resumes in July, it is assumed that we can start commissioning as of January.”
