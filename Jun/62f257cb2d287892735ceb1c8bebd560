Speaking at a press conference Thursday in Abuja, the Executive Secretary of CIGI, Hon. Nonso Ezedinma, said that Tinubu has the blueprint, business acumen and prerequisite experience to transform Nigeria the way he did as Governor of Lagos State. He said: “Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, as a former governor of Lagos state, has set the template for good governance, which today, has remained a reference point for other states to copy. “His legacies, as a leading Progressive politician is well known and acknowledged worldwide. He needs little or no introduction, given his credentials as a consummate politician, shrewd business man and a media guru. “The many legacies of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu are spread across nearly all sectors of the nation’s economy, spanning Banking, Oil &Gas, Real Estate, Media Management, ICT, Sports, etc, and has left indelible marks in the sands of time. “His foray into politics began after he left a very lucrative job with the oil sector, to become a distinguished Senator of the Federal Republic. As a Senator, Asiwaju showed his brilliance in politics, and quickly became a rallying point for his colleagues. “It was to his credit that the General lbrahim Babangida’s administration succumbed to pressure to hand over power, after the annulment of the June 12, 1993, election won by Chief MKO Abiola of blessed memory. “The Jagaban story in the struggle for the actualisation of that truncated mandate, has been well documented to warrant a recap here. “However, there’s a consensus, that what Lagos state has become today, as a mega city, was the result of the good governance template set by His Excellency, Asiwaju, when he was the governor of Lagos state for two terms, between 1999 -2007. “The Jagaban school of progressive politics has produced the largest number of governors, minister and top-ranking members of the National Assembly, including Senate President, House of Representatives Speaker and even the current Vice President. “Our area of immediate concern is to solicit your cooperation to highlight the positive accomplishments of Asiwaju in the field of politics, governance and industry, where he has left indelible marks. These are very huge credentials that he would bring to bear as the next president of Nigeria. “The All Progressives Congress, has no doubt put the square peg in the square hole, by fielding our Principal, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu as our Presidential Candidate for the 2023 election. Among the other contenders for the most important office in the land, Asiwaju stands shoulder high, in terms of experience, competence and popularity across Nigeria.” He added: “He is well respected in the international community for his good reputation, astute politics and business acumen. We are proud to declare our support for his presidential project and CIGI is ready to mobilize Nigerians from all parts of the country. “In readiness for the task ahead, CIGI has constituted structures in all the 774 local governments, wards, States and the Federal Capital Territory. Currently, we are embarking on a nationwide enlightenment and Mobilization campaign for APC members and supporters to participate in the on going INEC voter registration exercise. “We have a projection of turning over 50 million votes for our principal in the 2023 presidential election. The CIGl has an unshakeable confidence that Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, will triumph at the polls andbecome the next Nigerian president. “We urge all APC members to be resolute in their support for Asiwaju because, he will turn around the fortunes of the party, rebuild it and give it the proper focus in line with his progressive principles. “Nigeria, under an Asiwaju presidency, will experience both human capital and infrastructural development, equity, peace, justice and progress. An egalitarian, libertarian and plural society which we all desire. Nigerians should have the confidence that Asiwaju has the capacity and the ideas to move our country forward and place her in the comity of respectable nations within the shortest possibletime. “The Continuity in Governance Initiative Initiative, CIGI shall serve as the vanguard not only for the mobilisation of popular support for Asiwaju, but, also as a platform for the propagation of good governance under the Asiwaju Presidency.”   The billionaire business mogul and All Progressives Congress' candidate for Ondo South Senatorial District for the 2023 general elections, Dr. Jimoh Ibrahim, has congratulated the winner of APC presidential primary, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
