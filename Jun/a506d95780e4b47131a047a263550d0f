Father to Big Brother Naija Shine Ya Eye housemate, Angel Smith, has reacted to comments made by Cross Okonkwo during the final episode of the season 6 reunion. This is coming hours after Angel lashed out at trolls on Twitter who dragged her parents for taking money from Cross. The troll wrote, “Cross gave Angel’s father and mother money?”. Angel fired back at the follower saying “Are you out of your stupid ass mind??? Don’t try me this evening. My father and your boy did a charity case together and they donated to an orphanage. Cut that bs out. “You all better leave my Goodman alone; because I will go to war for him. “And let everyone call me angry and defensive; I do not care. Whatever narrative about me can fly but you see my parents? You will not dare label them as beggars”. Vanguard reports that Cross during the reunion while in an argument with Angel revealed a number of things he has done for her parents. Baron Meyagy, Angel’s father who wasn’t pleased with Cross’s comment took to his Twitter page on Saturday to question why he would go on live tv to give an impression that he had done stuff for him. He tweeted, “Dear @crossdabossike I don’t know why you’d go on live tv to give the impression that you have done stuffs 4 me? I asked you and several people to donate to a charitable cause my partner and I held 4 an orphanage for Xmas, of which u did & got tagged 2d videos? This is wrong!”.
