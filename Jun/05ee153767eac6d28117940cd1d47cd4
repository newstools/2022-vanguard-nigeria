The “Coco Baby” singer announced this on her Instagram page, noting that your PVC or temporary voters card slip is what you need to access the venue. According to her, the concert is billed to hold on Saturday, June 11, at Tafawa Balewa Square, on Lagos Island, “Let’s shut down Lagos for PVC. Let’s vibe for PVC. Follow the European Union’s @EU_SDGN and @YIAGA for more…” she wrote. Recall that actress Hauwa Allahbura last week also mobilized the youth to get their PVC through her ‘Pull-Up Naija’ initiative. Allahbura alongside some of her colleagues and thousands of youths defied the heavy downpour to be part of the historic gathering. The youth thronged the Freedom Park venue of the event on Lagos island, in their numbers. Addressing the youth, Alahbura said she decided to form the group following the need to encourage youth participation in elections and the voting process in the country. The actress urged the youths to endeavour to obtain their PVCs, adding “We are breaking the myth that our votes don’t count.”
