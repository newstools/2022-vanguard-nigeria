The group in a statement that was given to locals  and motorists along Birnin Gwari road ,said “even if you bath with money because of your wealth, we don’t care unless what is for Allah and we must protect people against oppressors to the best of our ability.” They captioned the statement ‘Message to Nigerian Government and the Citizens ‘ written in Hausa which was translated to English by journalists on Friday. Chairman of Birnin Gwari Emirate Progressive Union (BEPU), Ishaq Kasai confirmed the receipt of the statement.  He said  their coordinators from some of the wards intimated them that the Ansaru group came on motorcycles and dropped the pamphlets in their various communities as well as to motorists. Full text  of the statement: ‘In  the name of Allah the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful  ‘Message To Nigerian Government and the Citizens ‘ ‘We are Jama’ar Ansarul Muslimina fi Biladi Sudan. We want to inform you that the attack of Kaduna-Abuja Train is not by us, even though the attackers claimed our group’s name.  It is not everyone that we used to attack. ‘ Our mission is to work for Allah by protecting Islam and Muslims who are being cheated/oppressed. Our group’s aim is to become defenders of Islam and Muslims from the wicked Nigerian Government and other black African countries.” ‘ The name being claimed by the Kaduna-Abuja Train attackers is really our group’s name but Abul Barra is not the leader of our group ( Jama’ar Ansarul Muslimina fi Biladi Sudan). Our group does not concern much in making propaganda. Anytime we so wish, we will reveal to the public the name of our group leader and it’s mission.” ‘We want the general public to understand that, we don’t kill anyhow and it is not everyone we used to abduct unless if we are sure that he is a Kafir or an oppressor.”  ‘ Even if you bath with money because of your wealth, we don’t care unless what is for Allah and we must protect people against oppressors to the best of our ability.” ‘Members of public should also understand that, in the process of protecting Islam and the right of Muslims, we can be right or wrong but our wrongdoing would not be deliberate.” ‘ At this juncture, we are concluding by praying for peace to be upon the faithfuls”. ‘ From Jama’ar Ansarul Muslimina fi Biladi Sudan.”
