We don’t believe in turn by turn system of governance, but in capacity and competence. With the introduction of electronic voting system, victory is guaranteed in 2023 general election. We should get our PVCs. We are not joking. With Peter Obi, there’s a better Nigeria. Victory is ours. “By Next week, we are launching brand new buses for the party. With Peter Obi, we have won election. I am bringing Peter Obi to Ebonyi State to see us. The failures of leaders in APC is a credit to LP.
