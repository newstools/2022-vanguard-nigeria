The late APGA youth leader,  Mr. Emeka Alaehobi was kidnapped from his home at Ukpor in Nnewi South local government area on Thursday, only for his remains to be found yesterday in a neighbouring community, Utu. It was gathered that the kidnappers neither called the family, nor demanded for ransom until his dead body was found. Anambra State Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, Mr. Tochukwu Ikenga, who confirmed the incident said a corpse was found in the area on Saturday. He said: “When our operatives got to the scene, the corpse had been removed by some persons we are yet to identify. We have also ascertained that the corpse is that of the APGA youth leader.” Ukpor, the headquarters of Nnewi South local government area, has remained one of the most troubled areas since violent crimes became rampant in Anambra State. For instance, the local government headquarters and the police station in the area had severally been attacked by gunmen. Utu junction, which is also in the same local government area has of recent become a dumping ground for victims killed in other communities.
