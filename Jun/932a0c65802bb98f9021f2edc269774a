On Friday, the Super Eagles went down 1-0 against La Tri courtesy of a third-minute goal from Pervis Estupinan at the Red Bull Arena to end their tour of the USA in disappointment. The defeat came after they had lost 2-1 against Mexico on May 29. The two loses mean the 62-year-old Portuguese tactician has now suffered two straight defeats since his appointment to replace German Gernot Rohr as the new permanent coach on May 16. “The results of the two games the Super Eagles played against Mexico and Ecuador may not be too good,” Nwosu, who managed 60 caps for the Super Eagles and scored eight goals, said. “However, the performance of the players showed the level of improvement in the team. “I know results also matter a lot because Nigerians always want to win but then, we need to give him time to implement his own ideas into the team. Besides, he has done well by not just including the players in the NPFL but also using them in the two games.”
