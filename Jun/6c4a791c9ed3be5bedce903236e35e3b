By Emmanuel Okogba Victor Osimhen is on the radar of Bayern Munich who are in the market for a striker to replace Robert Lewandoski. Lewandwoski made known his intention of wanting to leave the club, even before his contract expires. The striker has been at the club since 2014 where he has enjoyed most of his club career sucess. The striker, only recently in an interview said his time with the most successful Bundesliga side is over amidst a rumored interest from Barcelona. Osimhen who has been linked to a number of Premier League sides has had a stint in the Bundesliga with VFL Wolfsburg. Corriere Dello Sport, an Italian news outlet reports that Bayern officials have contacted Napoli to ask for information about Osimhen and the feasibility of a possible deal. The striker has, however, remained coy on his future. He at some point, close to the end of last season said he was committed to Napoli and wanted to keep playing under coach, Luciano Spalletti. Napoli have placed a €100m price tag on the 23-year-old who finished last season with 14 league goals – the highest scorer for the team.
