He sighted previous criminal cases of murder against the defendant in which he was granted bail before he went to commit this recent offence. He also urged the court not to entertain oral bail application  as it has not been applicable in cases before now and urged the defense counsel to put the application for bail in motion so that they can equally respond. The presiding judge, Justice Efe Ikponmwonba  adjourned the case to June 27 for  hearing of application for bail. Vanguard News
