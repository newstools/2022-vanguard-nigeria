Keyamo in two tweets he authored and shared with our correspondent, said Buhari has provided exemplary leadership in the twilight of his administration, a feat he knocked President Olusegun Obasanjo for being incapable of providing in 2007 for his then Peoples Democratic Party PDP. Keyamo said; “OBJ are you watching? The kind of leadership OBJ failed to give @OfficialPDPNig in 2007 is what PMB just provided for the world to see: complete transparent process to pick a possible successor; no IMPOSITION; NO INTERFERENCE; who’s the democrat now? Congratulations @officialABAT”. Keyamo also lauded the northern governors forum in the APC for been very sensitive to the complexities of Nigeria by insisting on power-shift to the South. “The heroes of APC Convention are the Northern Govs who reflected the extreme complexity of Nigeria in their decision to move power down South; and PMB who proved to his disciples that he is everything but what he has been so unfairly accused of. Congratulations again @officialABAT”, Keyamo stated.
