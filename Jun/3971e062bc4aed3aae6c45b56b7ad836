Disclosing this in a statement sent to Vanguard, Richard Akinnola, Chairman, PYO Media Council, noted that the story was false, advising people to disregard the story. According him: “The PYO Presidential Campaign Council welcomes our distinguished delegates from across the country to Abuja for our presidential primaries. “As you settle down in Abuja, we implore you to kindly disregard various fake news making the rounds that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has stepped down. “The purveyors of these fake news are afraid of the huge political support base of Vice President Prof. Yemi Osinbajo. “Please note that no such action is being contemplated. Prof. Yemi Osinbajo is the leading aspirant, as attested to by the report of the party’s screening committee. He is ready for the primaries and very sure of his victory.”
