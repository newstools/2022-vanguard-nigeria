There is ongoing primary of LP in Awka where Umeh is to be nominated as the candidate of the party for Anambra Central. Umeh will slug it out with Senator Uche Ekwunife of PDP, Dozie Nwankwo of APGA and Chief Kodilichukwu Okelekwe of APC in the main election next year. There was excitement among LP members when Umeh walked into the venue of the primaries yesterday and chanted Labour Party slogan.
