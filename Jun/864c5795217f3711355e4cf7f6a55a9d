The church district made the pledge when its leadership led by Rev Dr JNG Okafor (District Superintendent) paid a courtesy visit to the Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, Abiodun Alabi. Other members of the church leadership that visited the CP includes, Rev U G Ukasoanya, Assistant District Superintendent, Rev E.I Edoro, District secretary, Rev A.E Ohioma, District Treasurer, Rev Z.O Owolabi, Rev Dr S.E Nwosu and Evangelist Prince Obed Chinonyerem, Security Consultant. Speaking at the event, Rev Dr. Okafor, commended CP Alabi for his dogged commitment and focus in tackling the security challenges in the state saying that Lagos is relatively safe because of the efforts of officers of the Lagos Police Command. He said: “As a church, we commend the effort of officers of the Lagos Police Command in ensuring that lives and properties are safe in the state. We will continue to pray for the command for God’s protection. “We believe that security is everybody’s business, so as a church, we pledge to support the command in any way we can, spiritually and morally to make sure that Lagos state is safe.” Responding, CP Alabi appreciated the church for the visit and solicited for prayers for his officers who put their lives at risk daily to ensure that the residents of the state are safe. He said: “I thank you for this visit which will motivate us to do better. The Assemblies of God church is one of the major stakeholders of Police and its commitment to crime control and peace building is something worthy to emulate. “We appreciate your support and plead that prayer should be persistently offered for the safety of our officers who stake their lives to ensure that the state is safe.”
