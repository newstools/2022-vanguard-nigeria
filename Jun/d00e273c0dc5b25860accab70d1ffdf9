In a communique issued at the end of its rally in Asaba on Monday and read by the Coordinator, Eziwomano Ighoegwo-Ogboru, the group said Okowa remained the two regions’ choice of a running mate to the PDP presidential standard bearer, Atiku Abubakar. The coalition, which passed a vote of confidence on the Delta governor for the excellent and exceptional performance of his administration in the past seven years, noted that he had been a bridge between the South-South and South-East, adding that his choice would appropriately address the Igbo equation. The PDP youth group maintained that Okowa stood a better chance with Atiku Abubakar to give the opposition party the much desired victory in the 2023 presidential election, given the fact that Okowa had remained a loyal party man and had diligently served the party in different capacities. It further stated that Okowa had, in his capacity as Chairman of the South-South PDP Governors’ Forum, carried his colleagues along without rancour and enjoyed a harmonious relationship with them, just as he was highly respected by even the APC Governors, which would make his choice generally acceptable.
