In a statement he personally signed and made available to newsmen in Akure, the Ondo State capital, Adedipe urged the Federal government to live up to its expected responsibility of protecting lives and property. The legal luminary asked the security agencies to fish out, those behind the massive killing of innocent citizens, who were in Church to worship. Adedipe said: “It is inconceivable that such an attack, that happened in Owo, could have taken place without a belief that they can never be caught and punished. “Therefore, the Federal government should wake up to its constitutional responsibility, to fish out the criminals and make them get punished, to let them know that the society we seek to build, is the one that is anchored on the rule of law. “Whatever might be their motivation, killing worshipers or anyone for that matter is unacceptable. “Ondo State is a peaceful and tolerant state. For these individuals, whoever they might be, to have come into a church premises and kill innocent worshippers in an execution style, on a holy day, is a cynical attempt at provoking religious war and we would resist that. “But these criminals including their sponsors, and enablers should be fished out and punished unreservedly. Adedipe has therefore “sympathized with the people of Owo town, Ondo State, and Nigerians at large.”
