The Council which reacted to the Sunday killing of over 50 parishioners at the St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State stressed the only way the souls of the victims would rest is the assurance that their killers will be arrested and dealt with according to the laws of the land. Addressing journalists On Monday in Jos, the National President, Catholic Laity Council of Nigeria, Sir Henry Yunkwap in the company of the National President, Catholic Women Organization, CWO, Dame Mary Gonsum, and other officials of the Catholic Archdiocese of Jos, the body sympathize with the people of Ondo Diocese and prayed for the quick recovery to the injured. According to Yunkwap, “It is very important that I address you this moment considering the happenings in our country as regards insecurity. We are aware that yesterday (Sunday), more than 50 parishioners of St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State were killed by gunmen suspected to be bandits. I find it difficult to address my people knowing full well that we are yet to recover from the recent murder of our daughter and friend, the late Deborah Samuel by some heartless religious extremists in Sokoto State… “As believers in Christ Jesus, we are called to be peace-loving people and to preach it with words and actions but that does not mean we should not be sensitive to happenings around us and take action when necessary. To our leaders and all those who feel they have a monopoly on violence to know that every life is sacred and nobody has the right to take it in whatever way be it under the guise of religion, ethnic or political differences. “The crime committed by those killed were just two; one, they were Christians, and secondly, they were in the Church on Sunday, worshiping God. As a Christian group and direct mourners of this sad incident, we do not want to only condemn this barbaric act but use this medium to let the government know that we have taken enough of this killing of our people and we now find it very difficult to chew what they have forcefully put in our mouth. The only option left is to throw it out. “For any government who cannot provide security for her people, it is indirectly telling them to defend themselves by whatever means they can… What the victims want from the government for their souls to rest in peace is the assurance that their killers will be arrested and dealt with according to the laws of the land.”
