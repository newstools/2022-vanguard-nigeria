VICE President Yemi Osinbajo on Monday rendered a helping hand to an accident victim along Abuja airport road as he ordered that the ambulance in his convoy be used to take an accident victim to hospital. An online platform had reported that Prof. Osinbajo’s convoy was involved in an accident in Abuja, but the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President, Laolu Akande debunked the report. Akande said, “On his (Osinbajo) way to the airport this morning, VP came across a road traffic accident, stopped to lend assistance, and ensured victim was taken to the hospital with VP’s convoy ambulance. “He then proceeded on his trip and is now in Ondo State heading to site of yesterday’s attack in Owo.”
