The monarch, while speaking at the handing over of a Hilux utility patrol vehicle purchased by Bishop and Mrs Felix Owolabi to Amotekun corps in Ifedayo local government, said recent event in the country, especially the massacre in Owo, is a pointer to the fact that there is war in the country. He said, “What happened last year in Igangan and yesterday in Owo is a sign that we must be very vigilant. It is important that the government should help the boundary communities and beef up the security in those areas. “Without security, we cannot get anything done. If there is no peace, we cannot do anything. We have alot to do in terms of our security and I pray God will assist us”. In his address, the donor, Bishop Owolabi while acknowledging the fact that government alone cannot tackle insecurity, he said he was moved to donate the vehicle to aid Amotekun personnel movement in the area. “National peace, public security and social stability are extremely important for any country in the world. Nothing is possible without peace and stability. “As friends, we know fully well that the Nigeria Police and other Para military outfits are logistically handicapped in providing adequate and effective security to the Nigerian Society. “This donation is mainly intended to show solidarity with security agencies and at the same time, we do hope that the patrol vehicle can help AMOTEKUN Security outfit in a modest way to fight against crimes and provide better and more effective security protection for the residents in Oke-lla Orangun in particular and Osun State at large”, he said.
