The Big Brother Naija ‘shine ya eyes’ reunion has come to an end and Tega Dominic has penned an appreciation post to the platform for the opportunities and memories it has created for her, saying that the show made her realize who she is. Sharing on her Instagram page, Tega revealed that the post-BBN life is gradually becoming her reality and she will get better at it, slowly but surely. “Super grateful for the platform, will have it again? Yes (because I have coconut head, but a bit differently), it made me realize who I am, my elasticity and my capabilities. This life is gradually becoming my reality, I will get better at it, slowly but surely. “Thank you to everyone who gave me a hug when it was rough and still does, I love you, soon you will be glad you are still here, it was a reality SHOW for me and it ended well, am I proud of myself? Yes. “To my genuine friends I made from the house, we keep sailing strong, thanks for standing by and all the checkups, I appreciate you. Thank you @bigbronaija @dstvnigeria thank you genuine T-hearts. From me, it’s a wrap”.
