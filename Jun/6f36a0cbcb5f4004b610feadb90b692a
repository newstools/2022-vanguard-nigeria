Former presidential aide and social media commentator, Reno Omokri has been warned by Nollywood actresses, Tonto Dikeh and Nkechi Blessing Sunday to keep their names out of his mouth. This is coming after Reno likened the former Lagos Governor to Tonto Dikeh and another Nollywood actress, Nkechi Blessing. Omokri, while reacting to a viral video of Tinubu saying Buhari would not have emerged as president in 2015 without him wrote on Twitter: “Tinubu is just behaving like Tonto Dikeh and Nkechi Blessing. Like a woman who was promised marriage and jilted and is now exploding and exposing the jilter. Buhari don buy market.” Reacting, Tonto Dikeh in a post on Instagram dragged Omokri, describing him as former Vice President Atiku Abubakar’s houseboy and bingo who is always fingering on Twitter from exile. Tonto Dikeh wrote: “Renooo Atiku’s Houseboy, Twitter fingering from exile. If your mummy born you well come to Nigeria, always on the wrong side of history… Look at the difference your mate Peter Obi is creating. Rather, you are here fighting young girls with bigger dreams than being a bingo to an oga!!! I will come back to give you a reply when Peter Obi wins, as for now, I’ll let you run your errands.” In response to Omokri’s comparison, Blessing said Omokri should not allow God to punish him, adding that he doesn’t have common sense. “I used to think you have sense but it’s obvious you lack common sense. Why put me in this context in the first place? Welcome to Nigeria, when a relationship ends, automatically it’s the man that left the woman…I for like talk more but Instagram guidelines won’t allow. Mr Reno leave my name out of your mouth..no let God P#nish you,” Nkechi wrote on Instagram.
