He said no meaningful discussion had taken place between him and Okupe, who is now the campaign manager for Obi, adding, “On Doyin Okupe, it is unfortunate that people takes someone else for granted. I wonder why people wants to use others for their selfish interest.  “I am fighting for Justice. There’s no where in any political party that an acting national secretary can take over the national chairmanship position. We have the deputy vice-chairman and the zonal vice Chairmen.  “There is no where in the constitution that says an acting national secretary could take over the leadership of a political party when the deputy national chairman and zonal vice chairmen. I am not witch-hunting Peter Obi.  “When Okupe called me, I told him that I was open for discussion. I was now surprised when he went to the media and said a different thing from what I told him.  “It is clear that he wanted to take me for granted. The leadership of the other faction is going about that I’m looking for recognition. It is an insult to me as a person.  “They should know that their leader is an acting national secretary while, I Calistus Uju Okafor is the acting national chairman. The court will soon remove them. I am very open to any discussion for the right thing to be done.  “The leader of the other faction should remain as the acting national secretary while I play my role as the acting national chairman. Every other positions in the Labour Party remain the same until we all obey the consent judgement that says an all inclusive and expansive convention be held.”
