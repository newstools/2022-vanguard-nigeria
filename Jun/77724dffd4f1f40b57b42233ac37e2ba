Speaking to newsmen in Lafia on Sunday, the State Southern Zonal Chairman of Peter Obi Candidacy Movement, Victor Laka, explained that the youths decided to support the former Anambra State governor because of his leadership qualities. Laka further said that the group, with members from across the 13 Local Government Areas of the state, was tired of politicians from other political parties who kept lying to the masses of providing good governance during electioneering campaigns but ended up disappointing them. He noted that it was the reason they decided to support the Labour Party to produce Obi as President in 2023. He said, “As youths who want the progress of Nigeria, we are tired of all the politicians who keep deceiving us that they will provide good governance. Life has become so difficult for the youths because we have bad leaders and that is what we are trying to correct in 2023. “So far, 15,000 youths have registered with our support group, the Peter Obi Candidacy Movement, and more have indicated interest to join us in the struggle to rescue our nation from the corrupt politicians who do not mean well for us. “Our universities have been closed for many months now but they are not worried because their children do not attend Nigerian schools. Such leaders are not supposed to continue piloting the affairs of this nation, that is why we are supporting Peter Obi of the Labour Party to emerge as president. “We have great confidence in him because he did very well in Anambra State while he was governor. We believe he will do better if he is elected as president of Nigeria in 2023. So, we are urging all Nigerians who are yet to get their Permanent Voter Cards to do so immediately in order for us to vote in credible leaders to office in the coming elections.” On his part, the State Chairman of Labour Party, Alexander Emmanuel said over 50 support groups had visited the state secretariat to declare support for Peter Obi since he emerged as presidential candidate of the party. He expressed confidence that the party would win the 2023 presidential election and all elective positions in Nasarawa State, adding that the citizens were tired of bad governance at both the national and state levels. He said, “In Nasarawa State, over 50 support groups have indicated interest to support Peter Obi and the party in the coming elections. Nigerians are tired of bad governance, that is why they are coming to declare support for our candidate. “The leaders of other political parties know the antecedents of Peter Obi. They are scared of him but whether they like it or not, he will be our next president in 2023 because the people have spoken their minds. “We will also win the governorship election in Nasarawa State so that our people can enjoy the dividends of democracy. “With the kind of support we are getting, I am certain that Labour Party candidates will win their elections with a landslide in 2023.”
