He added, “I was in Ilaro, my own home town, for an inspection of a project, after which some unknown guys walked up to me for the normal appraisals. ‘We watch your movie’, ‘give us money, ‘We watched you all through our childhood’…All these as an actor we hear everyday. “I offered all I had on me and one of them dragged me by my Agbada and demanded for an amount I can’t pay. I asked him to leave me, he said, ‘Do your worse’. The rest is story.” The actor further appealed to fans to desist from harassing entertainers for money just because they are entertainers. “Do you pay anyone for doing your job? No. It’s our job too.
