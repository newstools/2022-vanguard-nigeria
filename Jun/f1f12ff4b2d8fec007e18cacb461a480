He also urged security agencies to investigate allegations of vote buying in some areas across the state. Speaking with newsmen after casting his vote at PU 006, town hall, Ogbon Iro in Ifaki, Oni said: “Those who know that they are not winning are the ones spreading the rumours. “Their propaganda will not work. They said I met with Asiwaju (Bola Tinubu) sometime in Akure but what they did was to do a Photoshop of me and Asiwaju sitting together. I have not met Asiwaju over a year or two “ On alleged vote buying in some parts of Ado Ekiti and Oye local government areas, the SDP candidate urged security agencies to wade into the matter and bring the culprits to book.
