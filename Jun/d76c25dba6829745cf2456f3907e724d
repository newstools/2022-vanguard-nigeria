In an Instagram post she made recently, Angel also bragged about the other thing she will be doing. “I will be doing palm readings, I can predict the future. Come to me.” Angel posted. Under the comment section of the post, a fan, who probably has been seeking ways to win Angel’s attention, tried his luck, as he asked Angel if she has ever seen a future together for her and him. “Then you must know we are meant to be together, @theangeljbsmith”, the fan asked the question, which never got answered by Angel.
