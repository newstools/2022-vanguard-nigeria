The National Chairman of All Progressives Congress, APC, Abdullahi Adamu’s claim that the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, is the party’s consensus candidate has stirred the hornet’s nest. Adamu’s comment, insiders said, has caused a hoopla and members of the party’s National Working Committee, NWC, are divided. Contrary to the position of most northern governors on power shift to the South, Senator Adamu had announced Senate Lawan as APC consensus presidential candidate. Adamu, Vanguard gathered, announced this at the meeting of the NWC, on Monday, in Abuja. However, some members of the NWC, sources said, kicked against the move and insisted that other presidential aspirants must be allowed to contest the primary election at tomorrow’s convention scheduled at the Eagle Square, Abuja. Other aspirants are Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, Engr. David Umahi, Yahaya Bello, and others. Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has said that he has no anointed presidential candidate going into the primary elections of APC, slated for tomorrow. The President also said he is in agreement with the position of the APC northern governors that power should be shifted to the southern part of the country in 2023. This is just as the APC northern governors have disowned the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, for opposing their position that power should go south. And, reacting to the northern governors’ position, Bello worked out on them. A video that has gone viral shows a furious Governor Bello storming out of the venue, followed by an entourage. Vanguard will bring you details of development with the APC’s NWC as they unfold. Vanguard News
