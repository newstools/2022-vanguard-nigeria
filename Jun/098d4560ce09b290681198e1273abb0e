The former governor of Kano State and presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, Saturday, confirmed that his party is in talks with Labour Party and its presidential candidate, Peter Obi for possibility of forming a coalition. Kwankwaso made this know in an interview with BBC Hausa Service on Saturday. He said: “We are really talking to Peter Obi, or at least saying that the committee is working to look into the matter (and cooperate with him), and friends and family are coming to talk to us about it.” Since Obi and Kwankwaso declared their political interests, they have both received a large following in the major parts of the country. Mr Obi had recently defected from the PDP and joined the Labour Party and has endeared himself to large youth following in the southern part of the country. Vanguard reports that Obi on Friday named former presidential spokesman, Doyin Okupe, as his running mate in a holding capacity.
