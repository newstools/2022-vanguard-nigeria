Jonathan who stated this in a condolence message to the Government and people of Ondo State said: “I offer my heartfelt condolences to the victims, their families, the entire congregation of Saint Francis Catholic Church, in Owo as well as the Government and people of Ondo State.” He denounced the “brutal killing in cold blood of innocent worshippers by mindless outlaws, out to cause havoc and mayhem in the society.” The former President further decried the nefarious activities of murderous criminals in the country and urged security agencies to go after them, adding that all efforts should be made to apprehend and bring them to justice.
