Nigerian singer, Tiwa Savage got Nigerians talking again after a video of her stepping out to a function in a carton colour jacket on white pants without a bra, showing off her cleavage trended on social media. In the video, Tiwa Savage who seemed uncomfortable with the outfit was seen using her hand to cover her chest at some point. For celebrities in the Western world, it is a norm for them but many Nigerians often frown at singers who dress in such style. The video generated mixed reactions from netizens, while some lashed at Tiwa Savage, others defended her. 13.
