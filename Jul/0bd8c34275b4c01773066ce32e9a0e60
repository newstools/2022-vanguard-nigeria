On the unpredictability of where the pendulum will speak, Enefaa Georgewill, Chairman, Civil Society Organisations, Rivers state, said, “We are happy at the turn of events. We have always wanted an end to the 1999 Rivers political class. The list we have seen signifies that end with majority fresh faces. “Added to the new electoral law adjustments, what that means is that candidates can no longer hide behind the strength parties and godfathers. They must come out to speak to the people. Convince the electorate on genuine plans to revamp the economy, encourage productive agriculture, education, vocational skills and all that. We don’t know where it will go yet.” Former National Publicity Secretary,  Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and National Coordinator, South South Elders Forum, Chief Anabs Sara-Igbe said, “It’s still a tentative list. Let’s wait for the final list before we can talk on where the pendulum swings. New names are likely to come in.”   By David Royal The Governorship candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) Rivers State, Mr. Tonte Ibraye, has announced Nollywood controversial actress, Tonto Dikeh as his running mate for the 2023 governorship election in the state.
