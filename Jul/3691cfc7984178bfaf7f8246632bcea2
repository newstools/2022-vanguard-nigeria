Director, Media & Advocacy, Femi Babafemi made this known in a statement in Abuja. Babafemi said the fleeing terror suspect, Suleiman Sidi, was arrested in the early hours of Monday 11th July at Area 1 motorpark, in the Federal Capital Territory while attempting to board a commercial vehicle to Maiduguri, Borno state. When he was searched, three wraps of cannabis sativa were found on him.
