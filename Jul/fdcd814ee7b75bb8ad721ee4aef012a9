There is a semblance of calm after police took over the premises of Bauchi State House of Assembly following an attack on the facility by a group of unidentified hoodlums. Vanguard gathered that on Sunday night some hoodlums had attempted to set the Bauchi State House of Assembly complex on fire. It is not clear the reason behind the attempt to burn the facility, but feelers are that it is not unconnected to the current leadership crisis rocking the assembly.
