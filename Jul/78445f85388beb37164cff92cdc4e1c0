The Delta State is too productive and strategic to be left to be taken over by herdsmen. “Every governor in the country is mobilising to create their sub police such as vigilante with uniforms and financing them, but here, Delta State is littered with rogue Fulani herdsmen and our people are afraid to go to their farms. “I felt at this time, the government of Okowa would sit down with local government and community leaders and plan on how to defend the state.
