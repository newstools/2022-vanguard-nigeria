The group, in the statement on Friday,said Babachir and his co-travellers in the “myopic, sentimental stance, should stop this madness in this new century of advancement all over the world.” The AYCF queried Babachir and all the proponents  of “this distraction and dangerous religious extremism”, saying ” we are familiar with the antics of narrow-minded, emotionally-driven politicians wearing religious garb”. The AYFC then pointed out: ” Talking of Muslim-Muslim ticket, have these people become so blinded by emotional religious fixation that they forgot history? We had Christian-Christian ticket with Awolowo under the UPN in 1978 and Azikiwe under the NPP when he picked Professor Ishaya Audu – another Christian as running mate”. Going further, the AYCF recalled that “since the emergence of democracy till date, the South-south, South-east States have never given the chance for Muslims to taste the seat of  running mates even at the level of governorship”. The statement warned the “anti-Shettima campaign promoters to stop before they create bad blood along religious fault-lines and drag the nation into further insecurity”    By Emem Idio, Yenagoa A founding member of the All Progressives Congress ,APC, in Bayelsa State, Prince Preye Aganaba, has expressed disappointment over inflammatory and extreme views expressed by a former Secretary to the Federal Government (SGF), Babachir Lawal on the same faith presidential ticket of the APC.
