The group is formed in pursuit of positive change, good governance and sustainable development. “I have donated my building to serve as a secretariat for Labour Party, to show my support and demonstration of my confidence in Mr Peter Obi’s capacity and competence to entrench good governance in Nigeria”. Also, another Co-founder of the group, Mr Gabriel Nzewi, said they have started mobilising Nigerians across all the electoral wards in the six geopolitical zones in the country to get their PVC ready, vote and defend their votes during the election. Nzewi said; “I urge Nigerians to strongly support and vote for Peter Obi in the forthcoming presidential election.

He urged those who have not registered to take advantage of the ongoing Continuous Voters’ Registration exercise to register to enable them change the narrative of bad governance in the country through their votes. A member of the group, Zainab Darlington, who also spoke during the ceremony, said; “an Obi’s presidency will not only heal the wounds of bad governance, but will lay the foundation for a New Nigeria. “We have all complained about the failure of the Nigerian government to deliver good governance to its people, we need to go beyond complaining to taking action in the direction of our hopes.” In his remark, Delta State Chairman of Labour Party, Chief Tony Ezeagwu, commended the group for the donation and urged them to remain committed to the project and enjoined them to help strengthen the party in their various localities.
