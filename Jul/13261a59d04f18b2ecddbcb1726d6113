This is even as the NGX, Friday, suspended trading on the shares of nine companies over their failure to render the 2021 full year financial reports to the Exchange. The companies are Mutual Benefit Assurance Plc, Coronation Insurance Plc,  Niger Insurance Plc, C&I Leasing Plc, Ekocorp Plc, Ardova Plc,  Royal Exchange Plc,  Premier Paints Plc, and African Alliance Insurance In a notice on its website,  the NGX said: “In accordance with our default filing rules, the suspension of trading in the shares of the above mentioned companies will only be lifted upon the submission of the relevant accounts, provided the NGX Regulation Limited (NGX Regco) is satisfied that the accounts comply with all the applicable rules of the Exchange.” Meanwhile, analysis of the trading report for the six month period to June 30, 2022, showed that the market capitalisation rose to N27.935 trillion from N22.297 trillion, translating to a N5.64 trillion gain or 25.3 per cent increase over the period.
