He loves me and treats me like a princess. The only problem is that he’s very jealous. I daren’t keep in touch with male friends, as it’s just not worth the interrogation. Socialising with men even in a group is a no-no. My friends are getting fed up with me, as I hardly ever go out without him. As a result, I see less and less of them. I’ve always assured him I’d never cheat on him, but this hasn’t helped his insecurity. How can I prove he can trust me? Kemi, by e-mail Dear Kemi, You’re asking how you can prove your trustworthiness, as if you’re the one at fault here. By the sound of it, you aren’t to blame at all. You’re bending over backwards so as not to make waves. Yet, the problem isn’t you, it’s your boyfriend. He may be your soul mate, but he’s jealous when he has no reason to be. It might have been acceptable for him to be a bit wary at the start of your relationship but, after two years together, he ought to be feeling secure. You say he loves you – but it’s a possessive type of love. You’ve cut off your friends and given him far too much control over your life, all to make him happy. The answer is not to carry on tiptoeing around him. It’s to make him realise the reason he gets so edgy are nothing to do with you or your actions. Perhaps in the past other people had let him down  – maybe family, friends or previous partners have betrayed him – so, he’s extra wary in relationships. Or, perhaps, he doesn’t feel he’s good enough for you, or is scared you’ll find someone better, so he’s overly anxious all the time. He has to learn to trust you. Tell him lovingly but firmly that he’s seeing things wrongly. It was other people who let him down in the past, not you. Then work towards getting your social life back. Make contacts with lost friends, male or female, and go out with them once in a while, without him tagging along. This won’t be easy. He will get anxiously and insecure so much you might be tempted to back down so as to avoid friction. But don’t give in. Instead, aim to build a relationship based on trust, rather than jealousy.   Dear Bunmi, I met my boyfriend months after my marriage broke up. After a few dates, I moved in with him, though I kept my flat where my two children lived with my mother. It was a complete disaster.  I discovered he was a heavy drinker and took drugs. He’d disappear… In "News" Dear Bunmi, When I met my current boyfriend, he never mentioned anything about having a half-brother. We’d been together for about a year when he introduced him to me at a social gathering.  It was a bit of a shock, and even more shocking was the immediate attraction between us. It… In "Relationships" Love Dear Bunmi, I met my boyfriend six years ago when we were under-graduates but I’ve worked with my dad for some four years now. I also live in one of his flats. My boyfriend got a job three years ago and is currently living with me. I pay virtually… In "Relationships"
