Eshiet said that the command would intensify a campaign on the need for drivers to have their licences while on the road. “The sensitisation will also be targeted  at awakening the consciousness of the motoring public on the penalty for driving without a valid license. On motorists yet to get their valid licences, Eshiet said defaulters risk a N10,000 fine or six months imprisonment or both. “We are not after punishing people. We encourage all motorists to process their licence and be on the road without fear of arrest by our personnel,” he added. Eshiet  urged motorcycles and tricycles operators to ensure that they are registered before plying the road, adding that “everything we do is for the overall interest of the motoring public.
