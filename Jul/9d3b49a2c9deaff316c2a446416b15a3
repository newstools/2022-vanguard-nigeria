In terms of other artists that I would like to work with it would have to be Rema. I really like his music and I feel like in a couple of years he will be one of the biggest names coming out of Nigeria.

Continuing he said, “I’ve been doing music since I was 13 years old. That was when I wrote my first song. I ended up going to a professional recording studio at the age of 16 and recorded a song called “Ups And Downs” . I never looked back, before then I was into dancehall music. I used to study all the latest dancehall moves as a kid so I can dance for the family at the family gatherings. Music has always been in my blood, It’s everything to me, it’s a lifestyle I write a song a day out of the love and enjoyment I get from creating it. I didn’t grow up with my father but I later learned that he’s a dancehall recording artist so it’s no coincidence”. Speaking on the global dominance of Afrobeat genre, the versatile act said “I’m a Hip Hop recording artist. That’s the genre I first started making music in, but what makes me stand out among other artists is that I’m a well rounded artist. I’m very versatile. I can do many sounds in different genres for example Dancehall, Afrobeats and Pop. I like making music that forces you to dance but most importantly I also make heart felt songs that bring emotions out of you. Songs that many can relate to, those are my favorite songs to make. I’m happy that the world is able to appreciate the Afrobeats on a global scale. It’s about time. It’s my favourite genre of music to listen to and Africa is one of the greatest places in the world, most of the popular artists that are dominating right now come from Nigeria and as a black person no matter what your background is you have to be proud of what’s going on in the industry right now”, said Supreme Swiss.
