He added that a total of N2.25 million will be given out as cash grants at the conference, with the top three young entrepreneurs awarded cash of N1 million; N750,000; and N500,000, respectively. This is in addition to getting business development support for bankable business plans, and becoming NASME Youth Ambassadors with one year free membership subscription to the association. The application closes on July 11, 2022.
