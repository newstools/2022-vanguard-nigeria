This was the reaction of the National President, AFAN, Arc Kabir Ibrahim, over the fast growing Nigerian population which food production is at an arithmetic dimension. Ibrahim maintained that without proper incentives for farmers the over 210 million mouths will face severe hunger if deliberate efforts are not made to boost farmers’capacity to produce food.

The enablers are: Address the power issue to enable processing, cold storage thereby elongating the shelf lives of otherwise perishable crops and value addition generally. “Make easily available and affordable credit to the youth to enable them invest in Agriculture at processing and agritrade level; Give access to industrialization hubs to the youth seamlessly.” He also called on the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC, to deploy huge number of corps members to the agricultural sector. “It will be wonderful to fully engage the youth corps members in Agriculture because we will evolve an educated critical mass to turn it around. “It will further consolidate the fact that Agriculture is a veritable business tool in the creation of jobs and wealth sustainably”, he stated. Meanwhile, he (Ibrahim) pointed that with the current situation with food production, the government and private sector should collaborate to establish more agro industrial areas for food production and employment generation. “I support the idea of encouraging Public Partnership Public, PPP, model of agro-industrial development as it will definitely generate employment for our otherwise unemployed youth”, he added.
