However, following the recent series of attacks, residents, including women and children, continued to flee the community for safety. The locals therefore called  on Government to address the continued loss of lives and property in the area.   The Birnin-Gwari Emirate Progressives' Union, BEPU, said yesterday that Ansaru terrorist group has banned political activities in many communities in the eastern part of Birnin-Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State.
