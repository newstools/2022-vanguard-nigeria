Borogo in Kaduna ‘We are in prison in our own country. Within one year, the Archdiocese has buried three while one of our priests is still in the hands of the bandits for over two and half years now. “Three weeks ago, I buried a priest without his body. It was terrible to say a burial mass was conducted without the body and all of them are very young and courageous priests. Father Borogo was the only one that was up to 50. “We are short of tears, we are short of words. He was killed on his farm, he has nothing to do with them, he never knew them, not even good morning, but they decided to attack him and killed him. “In our country, death has become a daily meal. Nigeria has been described as a home of criminality, banditry and terrorism.
