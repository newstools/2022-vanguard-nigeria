In a statement made available to journalists on Tuesday by the group’s hierarchy, thes said Atiku should drop Okowa to his own peril. The statement signed by the National President of OYC, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike and the Secretary, Comrade Obinna Achionye said any attempt to replace Okowa would backfire. The apex Igbo organization said the South-East would not accept to lose out completely in the scheme of things, having lost the opportunity to produce the presidential candidate of either the PDP or the All Progressives Congress, APC. “There is no need to repeat that we expected both the PDP and the APC to zone their presidential tickets to the South-East, but that did not happen. “Though this has been overtaken by events, the only consolation we have is the choice of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as running mate to Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, considering that Okowa is a true Igbo son. “Having said this, how could anyone wake up and think of replacing Okowa with Wike? As much as we know that Atiku reserves the right to choose whoever he wills as his running mate, we also have the right to vote according to our desire. “And that desire is clear- that the PDP would not get one vote from Igbo land should they field Wike, because this is a man who disowned Ndigbo. He said he is not one of us and this is payback time, we also do not know him. Should the PDP make the mistake of pairing him with Atiku, the PDP will be roundly rejected during the presidential election. “With the new Electoral Act, those who constituted themselves into emperors are going to be disgraced during the polls. The time for bogus fake results is over, so nobody should be deceived”, the youths said.
