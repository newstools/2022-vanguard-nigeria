No people would tolerate to continue to live under such conditions while being led by a government that appears to run from threats and incapable and lacking in the political will to challenge the threats.  Whether anybody wants to admit it or not, the current administration has failed in the vital area of providing security of life and property to its citizens.  “All the signs of imminent failure or perhaps complete failure of state have manifested in Nigeria as its government has failed to maintain a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force within its borders.  With the current dominant presence of warlords, paramilitary groups, corrupt policing, armed gangs, terrorism, and a messed up security apparatus of the country, the very existence of the state has been rendered dubious, and the Nigerian state is by all indicators appearing like a failed state.”   The Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) has blamed Northern Governors, law makers and council leaders for the challenges bedeviling the north.
