We demand prompt and complete implementation of the UN directives concerning Mazi Nnamdi KANU. “Binta Nyako and her jurists should know that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu’s life is in danger while being detained in DSS custody Abuja. Again, she should know that these terrorists attacked Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA) Kaduna, War Training College Jaji in Kaduna, Kuje Prisons Abuja and other security facilities in Abuja, therefore DSS facility is not immune  to attack by these state sponsored terrorists. “The Nigeria Government and its compromised security agencies must understand that danger is coming from their brothers whom they groomed to ravage and pillage the country.” IPOB said that treacherous Igbo politicians who colluded with the Federal Government to destroy Igbo land for selfish interests would find no hiding place, urging them to make peace now before its is too late. “We pity those Igbo leaders and politicians who commited crimes in Igboland and ran to Abuja thinking that nothing will happen.  “The narratives have changed and they will run to Lagos but Lagos will not be safe for them, then they will come back home soon and answer questions unless they run to abroad.  “One day all the evil and killer politicians from BIAFRA land will be held to account, and only the good ones will walk as free men and women. “This is opportunity to make peace with your people because danger is approaching to Nigeria soon, the country has collapse. “ Vanguard News Nigeria    By Biodun Busari The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has demanded that its detained leader, Nnamdi Kanu be released unconditionally from the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS) due to rising insecurity in the nation’s capital, Abuja.
