Igini, in a pre-litigation notice that was prepared by his team of lawyers led by Chief Clement Onwuenwunor, SAN, a copy of which he made available to Vanguard, alleged that the APC chieftain had in a television interview he granted on June 29, accused him of not only working for the PDP in Akwa Ibom State, but equally acting as a ceremonial consultant to Governor of the state, Udom Emmanuel. While denying the allegation, the INEC REC, said he would not hesitate to approach the court, should Dr. Agbomhere fail to within 48 hours, retract the said defamatory statements and tender an apology to him in four major TV stations and five prominent Newspapers. The pre-action notice addressed to Dr. Agbomhere, a copy of which was sighted by Vanguard on Sunday, read: “We act as Legal Practitioners for Honourable Mike Igini (hereinafter referred to as our client) and on whose instruction we write this protest and demand letter to you. “In a Television interview aired by Arise Television and anchored by Dr. Rueben Abati on 29th of June, 2022 and subsequently relayed in several other news media platforms, you maliciously published to the whole World about our Client as follows: ‘Mike Igini has abused the privilege of his office, he is partial/biased against the interest of APC in Akwa Ibom State, he is working for PDP in Akwa Ibom State, he is a ceremonial consultant to the Governor of Akwa Ibom State in electoral matters, he has compromised the values of INEC, he is a hatchet man hired by the PDP to work for them in INEC, shamelessly defending the rights of political parties and that he lives in the Lodge of the Government of Akwa Ibom State….. that he has videos of him driving in and coming out ………..’. “The above malicious accusations published to the whole World have, ever since, been given unprecedented publicity and they constitute the most wicked attack on the towering image of our client, who over the years, has earned a deserved reputation in Nigeria and internationally as a forthright electoral umpire. “Your said bogus allegations were hellish conjectures from the spiral imaginations of a mischief maker who neither have the fear of God nor regard for a man of probity in your misguided foray for ephemeral political power. “As characteristic of unrepentant blackmailers, you threw caution to the wind, and in your frenzied efforts to disparage our Client without checking your facts, you did not know (and will be shocked to know) that our Client does not know where the Government Lodge of Akwa Ibom State is located and that our Client lives in the official quarters of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Uyo, and this is very well known to you. “We have the instruction of our client to challenge you or anyone else to post your taunted pictures and videos to the whole World. “Our brief further confirmed, and this will even interest you to know that our Client has never visited the home of a human being, son or daughter or any individual in his home anywhere in Akwa Ibom State since he resumed as Resident Electoral Commissioner in Akwa Ibom State in 2017 and your allegations of being a hatchet man for PDP in Akwa Ibom State, a ceremonial consultant to the governor of Akwa Ibom State in electoral matters, are misguided and reckless in extreme.” Speaking on behalf of the Concerned APC chapter chairmen, Youths and members, Mr. Udeme John Akpan, who identified himself as APC chapter Chairman in Oruk Anam, insisted that Igini was upholding the tenet of democracy,  adding that it was only corrupt politicians that were against him in the state. He said: “We are here in a solidarity visit to ensure that truth must prevail. Igini is a man of integrity that is against forgery. He does not support changing or manipulation of election figures. ”Igini and his INEC team witnessed the APC Congress in the state and he insisted that the true election results produced at the congress must stand.” That is why he/INEC recognized Mr. Austin Ekanem as the authentic state chairman. ”We over heard days ago that some groups of criminals who are not real APC members demonstrated calling for Igini’s removal, they are criminals good in forgery and bribery. They were paid to do that, they are not authentic APC members”. Another member of the group, who identified himself as Mr. Ekebo Thomas from Onna, said the state had never had a free and fair electoral officer as Igini. “Igini is upholding the tenet of democracy both internally and externally. He is man that cannot be bought with money,” he said. In his response, INEC administration secretary assured the protestants of standing on the path of truth without compromise.
