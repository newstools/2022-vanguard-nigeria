According to Abbo in a  statement yesterday, with the Muslim- Muslim ticket that has been adopted by his party, his conscience will not allow him to campaign for the APC Presidential Candidate and his Running Mate, just as he  described the ruling party’s choice of Muslim-Muslim ticket as irresponsible, insensitive and ignorant  of the country’s political system. Abbo who was the first Senator in the 9th Senate to dump the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP for the APC noted   that he was  resigning  his membership of Tinubu’s support group over the Muslim-Muslim ticket of the APC. Senator Abbo said, “It is very irresponsible of Tinubu to take his political survival over the stability and peace of Nigeria,” Ishaku Abbo, the senator representing Adamawa North, blasted APC presidential candidate Bola Tinubu for picking a Muslim as his running mate. “For Tinubu now to be given the ticket and turn around to do what he couldn’t achieve in 2015 despite opposition from Catholics and other Christian leaders is extremely irresponsible “ The Senator who  accused Tinubu of refusing to take a cue from the opposition against his vice-presidential ambition and how President Muhammadu Buhari opted for a Christian running mate in 2015, said, “Buhari fought a civil war and understands the consequences of a divided nation. When Tinubu wanted to be VP in 2015, Buhari said no because he understood the importance of unity.”  Abbo who  explained how he met with a support group in Abuja in search of a running mate for Tinubu, said that the group had concluded that Tinubu should not pick a Muslim as his running mate for the 2023 presidential election, he told The Gazette. He said, “We sat down in Abuja and strategised, and we concluded that he should not take a Muslim as running mate. He (Tinubu) threw away the report. My conscience will not allow me to campaign for Tinubu. I am a member of CAN; I cannot deny CAN. I remain in APC. But I will take the survival of my country first over political considerations. “We cannot work for such a man. I will oppose (a) Christian-Christian ticket because I am invested in the stability of this country. A Christian-Christian ticket will be insensitive to Muslims of this country. The country is evenly divided among Muslims and Christians. So any government that is Muslim-Muslim will be illegitimate and will never gain the respect of Christians.”   SENATOR Shehu Sani has said that aggrieved Nigerians over the nomination of Senator Kassim Shettima, Borno Central as the running mate to the party's  Presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu ahead of the 2023 general elections have the constitutional right to express their objections  In "News" FORMER Federal Commissioner for Information and South South Leader, Chief Edwim Clark has lampooned the nomination of Senator Kassim Shettima, Borno Central, a Muslim as the running mate to the party's  Presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu ahead of the 2023 general elections who is also a Muslim.
