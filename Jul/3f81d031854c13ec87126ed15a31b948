They are there for all of us. They should ask and make their researches about what the country wants.” It stressed: “The pastor’s statement was not a political commentary aimed at attacking any personality in the country as wrongly portrayed and misrepresented by a section of the media. “His admonition on the subject matter underscores his sincere concern for a better Nigeria and prayer for God’s guidance on the leadership of this country” “We, therefore, urge members of the public to be wary of such misrepresentation.
