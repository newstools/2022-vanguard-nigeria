The group also said the present legislators of the region at the National Assembly have failed the Igbo race and insisted that they should be withdrawn from contesting the 2023 general elections. National Chairman of the forum, Dr Mike Ikegulu who stated this in a press statement he issued yesterday, via SMS, berated them for their public conduct and utterances, describing it as “disappointing” and “painful”, just to please the chieftains of some ethnic groups. Ikegulu said: “Since the emergence of the present crop of Igbo political and business elites, Ndigbo have continued to be shamed and short-changed. We are not genuinely being represented in any sphere of Nigeria affairs. “Their public conduct and utterances are disappointing and painful, just to please the chieftains of some ethnic groups.

One wonders why they are gearing up to return to the same indolent representation at the national assembly in 2023”. “Even the serving governors are buying their way to the senate as retirement home, this is unacceptable to us.”   By Ikechukwu Odu NSUKKA—The former national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP,  Okwesilieze Nwodo, has said that Mr. Peter Obi, of the Labour Party could actualize the dream of South Easterners by winning the Presidential election  in 2023.
