The debt agency had reduced  the average interest rates on the FGN Savings Bonds, FSBs, by 13 bpts to  8.58 per cent at the July auction from 8.71 per cent at the June auction. The interest rate on the 2-yr and 3-year FSBs were both reduced by 13 bpts to 8.075 per cent and 9.075 per cent respectively in July from 8.205 per cent and 9.205 per cent in June.  This move however  contradicts the upward trend in interest rates following the two consecutive hikes in the Monetary Policy Rate, to 14 per cent in July by the Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Nigeria. It also represents a reversal from the 26 bpts increase to 8.71 per cent on average interest rate on FSBs in June from 8.45 per cent in May.  In apparent resistance to the cut in interest rate by the DMO, patronage for the FSB dropped by 27 per cent at the July auction, as total allotment fell to N1.37 trillion from N1.87 trillion in June.  The 2-year FSB recorded the largest decline of 41 per cent, as allotment fell to N451 billion in July from N769.9  billion in June.
