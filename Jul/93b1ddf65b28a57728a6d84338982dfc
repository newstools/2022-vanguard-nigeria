Oba Kasali, who made the appeal during his one year coronation anniversary held in Esure, expressed displeasure over the loss of property and farm produce to incessant flooding . The monarch who commended the state government for the provision of road network, however, warned that if urgent steps were not taking, flood would destroy the roads and entire community. He said, “despite the efforts of the state government in the provision of road and healthcare centre, the town is seriously facing the problem of erosion due to heavy water that comes from about five towns surrounding Esure town. He however, appealed to the state government to intervene by constructing drainages to collect water from the five neighbouring communities in the area. He said, “Esure is facing the challenges of errosion because it has a sloppy ground, and majorly, all the water coming from Imushin, Odonopa and its environ was channelled towards to Esure town. “We have been able to execute some projects within one year on the throne; which included, revitalisation and building of a new market in Ita Esure; provision of solar power in the town which made the town protected from the activities of criminals who hitherto could hid under darkness to perpetrate their nefarious activities”. “We also provided walkie-talkie and security materials to vigilante to help ensure security of lives and property; construction of drainage channel at Olode street for flow of water and some other self executed project”. “We don’t have security issues, we have taken that up by ourselves by setting up a grassroots security. We have been able to empower our health centers with money, St’ Albert the Great Health Center. So, they can be able to do a lot of work”. “I’m appealing to the state government to help channel the errosion by providing drainage”. “We don’t have much problem in the area of health because that is part of my achievements to provide drugs and modern equipment for operation in the theatre of St. Albert, the Great Clinic in Esure for the service of the indigenes of Esure and Ijebu-Imusin in general.” While unveiling the proposed Ebelu’s palace complex design, Oba Kasali said, the town will have a befitting palace during his reign. In his speech, the Awujale of Ijebu and Paramount ruler of Ijebu land, Oba Dr. Sikiru Adetona, who was represented by the Dagburewe of Idowa, Oba Yinusa Adekoya described the palace project as a big one, appealing to both the indigenes and non-indigens of Esure to support the monarch in achieving the project.
