Speaking to stakeholders at a meeting in Lagos, Acting Minister of Transportation, Ms. Gbemi Saraki, said there is a need to create a database for these attacks while profiling them. Saraki explained that until these attacks are properly profiled against the reports of attacks by the international community, it will always be their words against our local maritime security reports.
