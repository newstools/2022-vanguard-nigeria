They lamented that famine looms in the  community if nothing was done to compensate them for the huge losses they have incurred from the destructions. The Farmers who spoke through the Youth President of the Community, Mr. Steve Ugboaja,lamented that the Fulani herdsmen invaded their community with over 500 cows and destroyed cassava, vegetables,maize, among other crops which they farm in large expanses of land. He said; “Farmers in Akpaa Mbato are now counting their losses over the destruction of communal farms in the community. Our people usually invest money in farming crops like cassava,vegetables ,maize, and other crops in large expanses of land, but all have been destroyed by Fulani cows. These farmers collected huge sums in loans and now, they are in trouble. Famine looms in the community unless something is done to avert the crisis.” Ugboaja disclosed that he had reported the matter to the Abia State committee set up to mediate between farmers and herdsmen.     *Occupy part of Okpanam community; food scarcity looms as farmers stay home By Emma Amaize, Regional Editor, South-South;  Jimitota Onoyume, Festus Ahon & Ochuko Akuopha  IN defiance of the Anti-Open Grazing law passed September 2021 by the Delta State House of Assembly, herdsmen still shepherd their cows with irresponsible impunity,… In "Features" •200,000 households destroyed, 65,000 children sent out of school By Peter Duru Makurdi — No fewer than over 2,728 persons including women and children have been murdered in Turan community of Kwande Local Government Area, LGA, of Benue State due to ceaseless herdsmen attacks on the community, the Association of… In "Metro" … 200,000 households destroyed, 65,000 children sent out of school By Peter Duru, Makurdi No fewer than 2,728 persons including women and children have murdered in Turan community of Kwande Local Government Area of Benue state due to ceaseless herdsmen attacks on the community the Association of Kwande Academia, AKA,… In "News"
