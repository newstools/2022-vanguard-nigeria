We import fuel, beverages and lots more. He has shown capacity and that was eloquent when he was the Governor of Anambra State. Peter is a wide fire. He is a movement and nobody can stop it. “The Governorship hopeful, Engr. Fidelis Nwanchor is a man of proven integrity and capacity. Our group was set up about four years and he was not in the picture. But as time went on, every reasonable man knows that Ebonyi is divided into three zones, namely Ebonyi North, South and Central. “All the zones have taken their turn in the rulership of the country and therefore, it should go back to the Northern zone, particularly Izzi LGA. No other candidate that is qualified. His track records show that he is the only politician without an enemy. He is loved by many and has the support of Ebonyi people. “He made sure that power goes back to South and that was what led to the emergence of the present administration. He is a good man without any protocols. We are tired of money bags politicians. I will never allow to my children to be enslaved. We are tied of criminals . “Our PVCs are important. From the newly signed Electoral Act, everybody must get his or her PVC and must vote in the election. Bad leaders are emerging because we are not voting and we have to defend your votes come 2023.” The group, which is powered by a non Governmental Organization, Equity and Justice Advocacy Nigeria, has been in existence in the State for over four years.
