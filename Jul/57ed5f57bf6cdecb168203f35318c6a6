The Managing Director of the company,   Mr. Aigbovbioise Aig-Imoukhuede,  made the assertion at the virtual media presentation of the company’s latest report, saying that the Mutual Funds industry has witnessed an increased patronage over the years, recording a 33 per cent compound annual growth rate between 2015 and 2021. The report titled: “Comparing Mutual Funds II – Apples & Oranges, and a Hand Grenade”, took a deep dive into thedifferences between the amortised accounting method, which most funds in Nigeria use and the international mark-to-market accounting method as applied to Fixed Income funds, noting that while the amortised method may be good for business because it gives a steadily rising increment in value, but it is fundamentally flawed. Speaking at the event, Aig-Imoukhuede said that adopting different accounting methods makes it impossible to compare the performance of the Funds.    He said: “We believe that the Mutual Funds industry needs to harmonize the way it accounts for its securities. There has been diverse ways in which the industry accounts and to our minds, that is not acceptable. “Some Funds use the amortised method, while others use the mark-to-market,   which is the international best practice of accounting method. What this means is that it is difficult to compare the performance of the Funds because we cannot say we have an effective “morningstar or yodelar” service in Nigeria. If we did,  we could attract international investment in Mutual Funds and it is also good for our local investors. “Secondly,  we find that the amortised accounting method has a fundamental flaw when it comes to dealing with interest rate fluctuations; and there is a possibility, however remote, it could lead to systemic risk in future.” Presenting the report,   Guy Czartoryski, Head of Research at Coronation Asset Management, said: “To a considerable degree, a Fund’s performance will reflect its fund manager’s skill in selecting appropriate bonds and market durations, given the different risks posed by different bond issuers and day-to-day changes in market interest rates. The only way to compare fund managers’ performance is if all funds mark-to-market their positions, but, as we have seen, few of them do. The absence of uniform mark-to-market implementation across the industry is an obstacle to competition.” He emphasised the need to support the growth momentum recorded so far in the industry, saying: “At just 11% of the size of the pension fund industry, we believe that the mutual fund industry needs to support its momentum with confidence-building measures, first among them is the adoption of market-to-market accounting and Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS). “GIPS would open the door to credible fund comparison services such as Morningstar, Yodelar and the Financial Times fund comparison service. These advances would pave the way to significant industry expansion and international investor participation.”   He asserted that Nigerian savers are now making the long-term transition from building savings with banks to a culture of saving with mutual funds, leading to the growth in the industry.  Vanguard News Nigeria    Volume of transactions in mutual funds, otherwise known as Collective Investment Scheme (CIS), dropped by 12.2 percent in 2021.
