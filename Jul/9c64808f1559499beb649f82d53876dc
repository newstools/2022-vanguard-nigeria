Joe Korka-Waadah of Ogoni, Rivers state extraction, member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and staunch supporter of former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, also urged leaders and followers of the party, particularly in Rivers not to lose faith in the Rivers APC Leader over the interim shakes in the party as he has never misled his supporters at any point in time Speaking from his Ontario base to Vanguard in Port Harcourt, Korka-Waadah stated, “Though the current electoral act signed into law in Nigeria is a step in the right direction, more needs to be done if the nation wants her elections and democracy to be at par with what’s obtainable in Western democracies to achieve good governance. “Vote buying at primaries or anywhere within the electoral process should result to automatic disqualification of the candidate or candidates involved. “That’s the only way we shall overcome rich people using their ill-gotten wealth from buying their way into power. Until that is done, we will continue to see wrong individuals emerge as candidates.” On the need for sustained loyalty to Amaechi, he “Advise party faithful to stand solidly behind our leader. He hasn’t misled us. In 2014 he took an unpopular stance at the time to move to the APC, a newly formed party. “This is when our faith in our leader, CRA (Amaechi) and love for our party is tested. Let’s not allow an interim wind to sway our resolve. Let’s stand shoulder to shoulder with our leader. That’s what political loyalty is all about.”   By Egufe Yafugborhi PORT HARCOURT- Despite recent high profile resignations from shaky Rivers state All Progressives Congress (APC), Canada based chieftain of the party, Joe Korka-Waadah, has advised Rivers people not to be distracted on voting the party's gubernatorial candidate, Tonye Cole as next governor of the state.
