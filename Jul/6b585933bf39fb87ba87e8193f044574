He acknowledged the review of the document, which was done with support of the Japanese Government, and that brought about development of a more integrated and sustainable approach to the growth and management of the nation’s water resources which was approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) on 3rd July, 2014. On essence of the workshop, he (Adamu) explained that it was an opportunity to evaluate the level of implementation of the National Water Resources Master Plan at all levels of governance. He added that it was also in preparation to the review the plan as proposed to hold in third quarter of 2022.
