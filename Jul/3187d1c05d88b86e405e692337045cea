That is how we have been shut out from participating in past elections because INEC officials do not yield to traveling to the bad the area,” he added. According to him: “Determined to be counted in election against the odds, in the last local government elections, I had to go to the community where they kept our own material and we took responsibility of materials meant for us to our village.” No school, hospital, electricity, water Given the level of neglect and deprivation, the community leader said, “I think we are the community least developed in the local government, if not in in entire Rivers State. We do not have school, no hospital, no electricity and no water.” “We have made several appeals to the state government to come and invest here. It is only recently we have had renewal of hope since the current government started giving us sense of belonging with concern for our road,” he said. Wike intervenes Nfata expressed the community’s commendation on Governor Nyesom Wike, for the ongoing construction of the 13- kilometer Rumuodogo Road.
