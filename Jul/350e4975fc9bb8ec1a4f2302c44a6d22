The party’s Deputy National Chairman, Alhaji Bashiru Apapa, made the appeal at a sensitisation programme for party’s members and the support groups for its Presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi in Ado-Ekiti. Apapa identified the growing acceptability of the party and its candidate as its strength ahead of the 2023 elections. He urged members to canvass for more support for the party’s success to make life better for Nigerians. Apapa said that Obi’s presidential bid enjoyed the support of notable leaders, who were tired of the negative drift of the nation in the hands of its past administrators. The party chieftain said that Obi’s goodwill and his past achievements were attracting Nigerians to the party. “We have not experienced what we are experiencing now in terms of people joining the party. We keep gaining more members and supporters every day; in fact, we are elated. “There are some people who did not believe that Obi could come out to contest and some leaders are in support of Obi. “We have the support of more than five governors that are supporting the party underneath. We don’t want to mention their names for now. “Our candidate’s past achievements have attracted supporters and again, not all of them believe that Nigeria should continue the way it is going now. “They want change in the country,” he said. The deputy chairman said that past administrations had made the party the centre of their criticisms, because they were afraid of the growing support from Nigerians, which he attributed to the party’s popularity. Also, the party’s National Legal Adviser, Mr Akingbade Oyenekan, expressed confidence that the party would secure more votes than all other parties in the South-West. Oyenekan said that people were anxious for solutions to the problems of the country which he said, Obi would provide. Also, the Labour Party Chairman in Ekiti, Mr Odunayo Okunade, expressed concern that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) did not continue with the Continuous Voter Registration in Ekiti after the June 18 governorship election. Okunade said that such discontinuance would disenfranchise some voters in the 2023 general elections. The state chairman urged INEC and other stakeholders in the elections to be fair to all political parties toward ensuring free, fair and credible polls.
