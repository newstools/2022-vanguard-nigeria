Prince lkim who disclosed that given the cosmopolitan nature of Uyo city, over 18,000 tons of Waste was generated on daily basis for dumping at the dumpsite, expressed satisfaction with the remedial measure taken to evacuate the refuse from the road. He stressed that, “there is urgent need for a larger and new sanitary dumpsite outside the state capital with a conveyor belt that will recycle the waste while also providing a more convenient and conducive environment with good accessible road for the dumping of refuse “A State Environmental Protection Bill has already passed first and second hearing on the floor of the State House of Assembly, and I call on public spirited individuals to partner the Agency and indeed the State government in the task of waste management and waste recycling” Other government officials present during the inspection tour were: the Commissioner for Environment and Solid Minerals, Sir Charles Udoh, the Chairman, Uyo LGA, Dr Uwemedimo Udo, the Councillor in-charge of Environment in Uyo legislative Council, Hon.
