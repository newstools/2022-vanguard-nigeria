The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) disclosed this in its Manufacturers CEO’s Confidence Index (MCCI) Q2’22 report made available to Vanguard yesterday. MCCI is a quarterly research and advocacy publication of MAN, which measures changes in pulse of operators and trends in the manufacturing sector quarterly, in response to movements in the macroeconomy and government policies, using primary data mined through direct survey on over 400 CEOs of MAN member-companies. The report stated: “In Q2’22, the MCCI marginally increased to 54.6 points, from 53.9 points recorded in the first quarter of the year, despite the plethora of challenges including poor access to foreign exchange for importation of raw materials that are not available locally, rising global inflation, aggressive drive for revenue by government, frequent collapse of the electricity grid, steady rise in price of diesel, scarcity of wheat and other manufacturing inputs due to the ongoing war in Europe, and wide spread insecurity that combined to limit productive activities in the economy during the quarter”. With the aggregate MCCI score at 54.6 points, being above the 50 baseline points, the report said it shows that manufacturers still have minimal confidence in the economy, with the expectation of improvement in the operating environment. The report further noted: “The meagre improvement in the index score in the second quarter of 2022 implies that manufacturers’ confidence in the economy slightly improved above what obtained in the preceding quarter. “This signifies that manufacturers responded to the economic challenges that prevailed in the quarter with appropriate survival strategies and adjustments including remodelling of production operations, after the marginal slowdown experienced in the first quarter.”   *MAN lists forex scarcity, insecurity, neglect of economy for politics, others *Policy environment should motivate investment — LCCI, CPPE By Yinka Kolawole Worsening structural and  fiscal challenges, coupled with the fallout of the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war seem to have dampened the enthusiasm of manufacturers in the nation's economy in the… In "Business" •As manufacturers’ confidence in economy wanes in Q1’22 By Yinka Kolawole Manufacturers under the aegis of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) have charged the government to put in place a survival plan for the sector, calling for the establishment of a National Response and Sustainability Strategy.
