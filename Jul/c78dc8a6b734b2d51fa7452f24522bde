What we have has been a legacy andthe impact of theological education has brought into the nation. Some greatinstitutions that are renowned for this – Harvard, Oxford, etc. have become thecream of the whole world. History made us know they started as seminaries butthese institutions later metamorphosed into other areas of education. JC Pool, the first Principal of the NigerianBaptist Theological Seminary, Ogbomosho was offered a license for a chartedUniversity by the then President, Dr Azikiwe which was rejected.   The same Seminary later became the firstdegree awarding institution in Nigeria. As far as this nation and Africa are concerned,writing and education are not our heritage. Treasures not documented andwhatever education is in Nigeria is heritage and an aftermath of TheologicalEducation in Nigeria. All the schools government took over started as missionschools and government was not maintaining the legacy of the mission schools. Whenyou talk of academic integrity and soundness, we find them among the missionschools across the country. They are still functional and focused in providingsound education. Government keyed into education and made it apolitical matter to fight religion. This is through legislation against the schools.History was also doctored out of the curriculum. Several subjects have been removedas well. The nation has lost its bearing in terms ofeducation with consistent strikes by ASUU which affect the future of thestudents.   We are yet to get our bearingin education. Late Chieg Obafemi Awolowo ensured education became a natural priorityto benefit the citizens but the reverse is the case today. It is worrisome thatwe have no value for education as the state of the nation’s educational systemis lamentable. Impact  The impact of theological education is multifaceted, as Theological Education gave birthto several churches. It also gave birth to the proliferation of schools. These arethe immediate impact but in the 1950’s, primary school in those days werevirtually free education. If children were very intelligent, themissionaries gave scholarships to children. As a nation, we have no value foreducation. The people who had primary education to standard 6 in those days canbe compared with a graduate today.   Themissionaries hired such standard 6 graduates and so many lives have beenuplifted. Missionaries hired them for several jobs in public sectororganizations. Help  Theological Education must be given a space toshape leaders. We need to watch the track records of our leaders. Our leaderseven boast that our votes mean nothing to them. We have a crop of leaders who have notrack records and all they do is to manipulate. Theological education has been ostracized. In thelast few years, Theological Education has been waged war against.   It is a threat/war against the source of Peacewhich is GOD. Theological Education can have a great impact on ourleaders which is a study about GOD. It is education that gives a transformationto be godly. In   Theological Education,you are taught how you must have concern for fellow human beings, whenutilized, the impact is huge. Theological Education indicates that God isindivisible, most people with sound theological education act right. Theological education can train people who will useand lead the people. Theological education has produced leaders for the countrywho are functioning in various places. Theological education has helped peopleto be versatile but they are being massacred due to selfishness, nepotism andtribalism in the country. God authenticates Theological education as we willall return to God. - [ ] •Oyemomi, a professor, is Rector, Baptist College of Theology, Lagos." srcset="https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/atiku-wike-1.jpg?width=1920&amp;auto_optimize=medium 1920w, https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/atiku-wike-1-300x169.jpg?width=300&amp;auto_optimize=medium 300w, https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/atiku-wike-1-1024x576.jpg?width=1024&amp;auto_optimize=medium 1024w, https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/atiku-wike-1-768x432.jpg?width=768&amp;auto_optimize=medium 768w, https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/atiku-wike-1-1536x864.jpg?width=1536&amp;auto_optimize=medium 1536w, https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/atiku-wike-1-1200x675.jpg?width=1200&amp;auto_optimize=medium 1200w, https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/atiku-wike-1-1568x882.jpg?width=1568&amp;auto_optimize=medium 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /> By Egufe Yafugborhi, PORT HARCOURT  GOVERNOR Nyesom Wike has accused 2023 Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar and party allies of lying against him in Atiku’s comments on outcome of the 30 May primary. Wike, just arriving Port Harcourt, Rivers state, from a trip to Spain, also said Atiku, party National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu and allies have failed to do the needful in reaching out to him towards resolving the conflicts generated by the contentious primary. He alleged the PDP flag bearer used event of the unveiling of PDP Vice Presidential candidate, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, and his appearance on a national television to lie against him. He States, “But there comes a time that people will understand and know the true facts. So, obviously, whether I will speak is not in doubt, to let Nigerians know the actual truth. Having known the truth, whatever they decide to do with it is left for Nigerians. “Because, you can imagine, the presidential candidate of the PDP Atiku, when he unveiled vice presidential candidate, no right thinking lover of this party would say the speech he made that day was fair. Forget the favour seekers. Forget about the scavengers. “But I never reacted to it. That is because this party belongs to all of us. Thereafter, he appeared on Arise Television, see the statement he made. So many lies were told and you said I should not react to some of those issues. That would not be fair. “Assuming today, I’m not alive, obviously what they have said would be accepted as the truth. Look at his (Atiku) attack dogs, Sule Lamido, Babaginda Aliyu, Maina Waziri. Look at the statements they issued. Look at the abuses they rained on me, but I never reacted. “And Nigerians will ask, you mean these things happened? So, it is important that as a person and for my own future, and for those who rally around me to say, look, this is not fair. So, I will make sure that I will react to them, line by line of the statements made by Alhaji Atiku Abubakar himself and his attack dogs.” Disappointed at Atiku on moves and statements following the presidential primary, Wike said, “Look at it, a presidential candidate who believes that he wants to win election, and somebody who contested fiercely with him that has never raised any issue. I just kept quiet, just minding my business, to see how my state can move forward. “But everyday, his people come up to attack me, to say one thing or the other. That’s quite unfair and so I should let Nigerians know at the appropriate time, that will be after the commissioning of projects that we have lined up. “We will say look this is not correct, so that posterity, history will be on our side that we have been able to keep the record straight. So, nobody should be in doubt whether I am going to speak on the issue of PDP, issues of the primaries and other related matters. “Nigerians will know what happen, Nigerians will know those who love this country, Nigerians will know what went behind. And that is to assure you am going to speak on that.” Governor Wike admitted that Senator Bukola Saraki met with him in Spain, but not sent by Alhaji Atiku, wondered why the PDP ticket holder who visited his home to solicit his support no longer knows the way to the house he once visited.   GOVERNOR Nyesom Wike says he would soon vent his feelings and perspective on recent happenings in the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, since the last presidential primary of the party.
