According to him, “ Lawyers are confronted with a unique challenge of both adding positive value to the society by using their daily professional exertions as instruments of so-called social engineering, and passively, by being seen to be above-board in all their interactions and engagements, either professional or otherwise. In other words, they are expected to be both Saints and Warriors. Whether this is feasible or, even humanly possible, is moot. Suffice it to say, that the verdict for failure (particularly in respect of the former) has always been harsh. Whether this has proved to be enough to deter deviant (or unprofessional) behavior is an open question. The same, arguably, is the case with the latter (sentinels and guardians of our common values). To what extent will you keep faith with that high ideal? Will you live up to expectations? It is up to you. Just ensure that whatever choices you make for actualizing your career as a Legal Practitioner, you are guided by the right values, topmost of which is our professional ethics. You breach them at your peril.” .<img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="960" class="wp-image-1875520" style="width: 800px;" src="https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/A-3-2.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/A-3-2.jpeg?width=1280&amp;auto_optimize=medium 1280w, https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/A-3-2-300x225.jpeg?width=300&amp;auto_optimize=medium 300w, https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/A-3-2-1024x768.jpeg?width=1024&amp;auto_optimize=medium 1024w, https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/A-3-2-768x576.jpeg?width=768&amp;auto_optimize=medium 768w, https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/A-3-2-1200x900.jpeg?width=1200&amp;auto_optimize=medium 1200w, https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/A-3-2-800x600.jpeg?width=800&amp;auto_optimize=medium 800w, https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/A-3-2-400x300.jpeg?width=400&amp;auto_optimize=medium 400w, https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/A-3-2-200x150.jpeg?width=200&amp;auto_optimize=medium 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Vice-Chancellor Igbinedion University Okada, Professor Lawrence Ezemonye, PhD, FAS (3rd from right) receives, Prince (Dr.) Richard Oma Ahonaruogho SAN (3rd from left) the Guest Lecturer at the Valedictory/Public Lecture of the Oba Erediauwa College of Law 2022 Graduating Class of Igbinedion University Okada.
