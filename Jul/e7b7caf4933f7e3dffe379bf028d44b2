The two men have been engulfed in a leadership tussle, each laying claim to the national chairmanship of the party. Vanguard reports that Oye had earlier in the week, called on security agencies to pick up Njoku for questioning, accusing him of doctoring the ruling of the Supreme Court on a case brought before the lower court by one Jude Okeke.

In a statement issued by the Njoku-led executive and signed by Okoro Benedict, national administrative secretary of APGA, the party noted that contrary to “puerile and infantile news being spread by Chief Victor Oye and his men that Chief Edozie Njoku has been arrested by some police operatives, this is totally false and baseless.” The statement read: “Chief Njoku was invited by the Nigerian Police through a letter dated July 19, 2022, to the Force Criminal Investigation Department, FCID. The invitation letter was signed by DCP Garba Ahmed. “This morning (Thursday), Chief Edozie Njoku honoured the invitation as a senior responsible citizen. The senior police officers in charge of the petition have given him a classical appraisal for turning up timely, conducting himself with utmost distinction and arming the police with Certified True Copies, CTC of the Supreme Court Judgement of the five Justices, Enforcement Order and Proof of Service on INEC by the Supreme Court. “The Police have called on Chief Victor Oye and his men to turn up and counter all the profound evidences that Chief Edozie Njoku had obliged them. Interestingly, Oye and his men are nowhere to be found. He that alleges must prove. He that comes to equity must come with clean hands. “We thank all our unassuming APGA members and teeming supporters. We want to ensure them that there is no cause for alarm.” Speaking exclusively with Vanguard shortly after leaving the FCID, Njoku said the whole exercise lasted for an hour, adding that the police would now proceed to the apex court to verify the authenticity or otherwise of his claims. “I wrote a statement and gave them certified true copies of the Supreme Court, enforcement order and proof of services on INEC by the apex court. The whole thing lasted for an hour or thereabout. They will call us on a later day after the verification of our claims,” he said.
