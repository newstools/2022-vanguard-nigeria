Onukwue said that investors are facing bleak future in    the second half of 2022, following continuous macroeconomic vagaries, supply chain disruptions arising from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, drop in production and trade growth, rising higher energy,    food prices, and    inflation among others said there would always be investment opportunities. According to him, regardless of the state of uncertainties in the global financial markets, investors that take sound investment advice from certified securities dealers, commonly called stockbrokers can enjoy superior return on investment on constant basis. Onukwue lamented that many investors often lose huge amount of money by relying on their own intuition or consulting unqualified investment advisers.    • As DMO raises N1.84trn from bond auctions • Borrowing to rise further in H2’22-Analysts Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed By Babajide Komolafe, Economy Editor The Federal Government borrowed N4.2 trillion from local investors in the first half of the year (H1’22), representing  21 per cent, year-on-year YoY, increase  from N3.89 trillion borrowed… In "Business" The Federal Government borrowed N4.2  trillion from local investors in the first half of the year (H1’22), representing  21 per cent, year-on-year YoY, increase  from N3.89 trillion borrowed in the first half of 2021 (H1’21) In "Public Finance" FG borrowing from bonds market declines 73.6% to N600bn In "Business"
