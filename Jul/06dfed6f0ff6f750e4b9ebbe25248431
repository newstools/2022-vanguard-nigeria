The former Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party, Abia State, described the decision as the “height of insensitivity.” Senator Nwaka who was among the PDP governorship aspirants, said that Muslim/Muslim ticket would not fly in a religious sensitive country like Nigeria. He said that by the action of APC, the 2023 presidential contest “is now between Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP; and Peter Obi of Labour Party.” His words: “I dare say that BAT’s pairing with a fellow Moslem for the presidency has upturned his ambition for good. ” For me, it’s the height of insensitivity and hubris personified. It shows they’re not moving with the times. “The Abiola/Kingigbe era cannot be re-enactef in Nigeria ever again, not in a country polarised like never by the obnoxious Buhari Administration. “For me, it’s now a two horse race: Atiku vs Obi. “Nigeria completely lost her innocence or what was left of it under Buhari. “It’s the saying of my people that special tactics is required to lift a woman with a broken waist. Nigeria is broken; we need tact, diplomacy and a deep sense of balance to heal it.” “You need both hands to lift a woman with a broken waist”.
