The organizers on Tuesday evening gave reasons for Portable’s disqualification. They stated that the singer was the founder of ‘One million Boys’, a suspected cult group in Lagos. “The decision to disqualify Mr Okikiola is accentuated by series of misdemeanors by Mr Okikiola via his social media platforms. “We shall not condone reckless and uncouth statements from artists and hereby disassociate ourselves from any individual linked to such assembly or activities linked to him as described. “The music industry demands all-round excellence. It is extremely important for young artists being potential role models to exude professional responsibility, proper decorum and have respect for others”, Headies organizers stated. Reacting to his disqualification, Portable said: “I am a child of light. I have fame, I have money, I have cars, I have wives, I have children. I am rich. People know me everywhere. I don’t regret my actions”, the singer said in a video while being caressed by his new wife.” Best Street Artist and Rookie of the Year were the two categories in which Portable was nominated.
