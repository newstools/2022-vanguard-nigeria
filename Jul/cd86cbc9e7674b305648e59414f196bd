This was revealed at the historic commissioning ceremony and official launch of Lagos Commodities & Futures Exchange, with the theme, “New Order, Driving Nigeria’s Economy Through the Commodities Ecosystem,” last week in Lagos. This feat, according to key stakeholders, will catalyze and transform the Nigerian economy to create value, wealth restore growth and build global competitive economy. Giving his Goodwill message, the MD/CEO of Heritage Bank, Ifie Sekibo, specifically stated that as the lead settlement bank in partnership with key stakeholders that are critical to the success of this project, it considered the launch of LCFE as huge potential to unlock the opportunities and wealth of the four asset classes, namely, Agriculture, Solid Minerals, Oil and Gas and Currencies. He stated: “I believe that this is the beginning of how we are going to possibly create values in areas that hitherto we have taken for granted. First thing it will bring about is sustainable commodity trading ecosystem, being a catalyst for capital formation, unlocking the long-time financing for the solid mineral and mining space. A frontline push to diversify the economy of this country from oil.” In his address, the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who appreciated the efforts of all the stakeholders, stated that the successful commissioning of LCFE will better fulfil the catalysts  of growth which is to attract cutting-edge ideas and innovation and improve the inflow of financial transactions and great ideas that will enable businesses to flourish. This, according to him, will improve the living environment, for businesses, and for the investments in Lagos and our country. Akin Akeredolu-Ale, MD/CEO, LCFE said, “As we are all aware, the Capital size of the Nigerian Commodities Ecosystem is so large and like I have said in the past, it can be considered as a $1trillion economy cutting across Agriculture, Oil and Gas, Solid Minerals and Currency. With a capitalisation this large, it was important to lay the right foundation as the means determined the end for us and we could not afford, not to get it right.” He said the Exchange identified that Nigeria’s crude oil has been traded extensively outside the country in Switzerland and other areas by large scale trading companies.    The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu at the weekend, demonstrated a clear understanding of the pivotal role of a commodities exchange towards accelerated economic growth and development.
