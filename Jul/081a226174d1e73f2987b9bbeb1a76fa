And those that are participating in the supply of this month’s food items are more than 24 groups of young, dynamic and hardworking local entrepreneurs. “As you can see, we are distributing garri for this month edition and the purpose of this is to further encourage and promote local production and empower our entrepreneurs. This garri is produced by our people and that is the focus of our Administration.
