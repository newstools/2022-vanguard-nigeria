Ogbonna noted that they were even more pained with the third place match they lost 0-1 to Zambia on Friday. ”It was our plan to secure the world Cup ticket and also win the trophy for a record 10th time. ”Like they always say, it is  a game of football and anything can happen. We tried our best but we are very disappointed with the overall outcome of our participation in WAFCON in Morocco. ”We thought we could win the third place match to compensate for not winning the converted trophy but it didn’t turn out like that,” she said.
