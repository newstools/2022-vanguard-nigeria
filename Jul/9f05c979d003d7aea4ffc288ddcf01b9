The medical doctors under the auspices of the Lagos State Branch of the Nigerian Medical Association, NMA, further urged Nigerian government to mobilise adequate funds through budgetary allocations to health as the country undergoes a transition process of a new dispensation.

According to him, there is need for the next dispensation to provide a health system leadership, governance and accountability that will ensure safe quality healthy services that are sufficient, fairly distributed, competent, responsive and productive health workforce as well as functioning health information system. Stating that NMA was committed to improving the quality of health among minorities and disadvantaged Nigerians, Salau commended President Mohammadu Buhari for signing the National Health Insurance Authority Act , adding that the act would guarantee universal health coverage for all Nigerians. “Health Systems are shaped by hardware and software elements.

This will conserve funds with improved health outcomes.
