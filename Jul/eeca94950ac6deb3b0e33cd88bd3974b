By Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja Should the controversial water resources bill recently reintroduced in the House of Representatives eventually pass into law, the federal government shall have the power to control all the resources found in the waters across the country. The power however is vested in the minister of the water resources who will exercise it on behalf of the government.
