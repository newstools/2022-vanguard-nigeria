The Head, Public Affairs Directorate of NC Front, Dr. Yunusa Tanko, and the National Publicity Secretary of NNPP, Dr. Agbo Major, confirmed the development in separate telephone interviews with Vanguard in Abuja yesterday. The Pat Utomi-led NC Front spearheaded the coalition which midwifed the adoption of Peter Obi as the presidential candidate of Labour Party. Tanko explained that the candidature of Peter Obi had grown beyond his political platform, Labour Party, into a mass movement which Nigerians across ethno-religious and sectional divides were identifying with. This, he said, had made it imperative for all citizens, irrespective of political party affiliations, to identify with. He said:  “The talks between the Labour Party which is the platform we in the NC Front, the #EndSARs and several other civil society groups have adopted to deliver this pan-Nigerian candidate to the best of our knowledge is still in talks with the NNPP which has some of our members. “We are open to partnerships which will deliver our motherland from the unimaginable suffering and insecurity we are currently experiencing. The mass unemployment, poverty and insecurity which we have been forced to live with in the past seven years does not discriminate among Nigerians from the North to the South, from the West to the East, we are all victims. “The sooner we realize this and work together to boot out the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party, the better for us all.” Speaking in a similar vein, the National Publicity Secretary of  NNPP, Dr. Agbo Major, confirmed that there were ongoing talks about how best to collaborate ahead of the 2023 general elections. He said:  “The 2023 general election is still months away, our leaders are still discussing it because we all agree that most Nigerians are tired of the mess the APC-led regime has plunged Nigeria into. “We need each other to succeed in this quest to rescue this country. Discussions are on and I can assure Nigerians that when we arrive at a decision, it will be made public.”   2023: LP, NNPP merger talks still ongoing, says Coalition In "News" NATIONAL Coordinator, Peter Obi 37 Merger Movement, POMM, Abuja, Tony Akeni, has entreated the National Chairman/Leadership of Labour Party, LP, and NC Front Third Force Mega Coalition to look away from  LP Presidential candidate, Peter Obi, and presidential candidate of New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, Alhaji Rabiu Kwankwaso, combination in… In "News" Obi/Kwakwanso talk: We’re working on a mega alliance – Abure, Okupe, Yinusa Tanko In "Politics"
