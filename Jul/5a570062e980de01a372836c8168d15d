This will not only include Youths in activities involving the development of the State but also an active engagement and public participation in the transformation of Enugu State. His voice, wisdom, experience, capacity, and articulation is needed for the emergence of the new Enugu State. “Let’s be Frank, there will be a dramatic improvement in Enugu State with Frank Nweke in power. “We are choosing to stand with Frank, We are endorsing a candidate with years of proven integrity and capacity, We are making a choice for a new and better Enugu, We are committed to mobilizing 100,000 voters, and we encourage everybody who has the vision of a new and better Enugu to join us and let us make this dream a reality”.
