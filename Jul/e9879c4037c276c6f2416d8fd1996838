According to BBC, United Arab Emirates’ flag carrier also accused the airport of displaying a “blatant disregard” for customers for pegging passenger numbers to 100,000 per day over summer. Emirates, on Thursday, said the airport now faced “an ‘airmageddon’ situation due to their incompetence and non-action”. Heathrow said it had no choice but to bring in a cap on departing travellers.
