By Emmanuel Okogba Host Morocco and Zambia have picked two of the available four slots for next year’s Women World Cup in Australia and New Zealand by qualifying for the semi-final of the ongoing Women’s Africa Cup of Nations. While Morocco did theirs in regulation time, Zambia had to go through the rigours of penalty kicks to overcome Senegal. After an early exchange of goals, it was defender Yasmin Mrabet’s second half goal that sent Morocco on its way. 2-1 it ended against Botswana in Rabat. Zambia cancelled out Senegal’s second half strike to end it at 1-1 after 90 minutes before winning 4-2 on penalties. Both teams have never been to a Women’s World Cup final, but with the expansion of the competition to accommodate 24 teams, Africa got two extra slots to increase its representatives to four – two of which have now been filled. With all semi-finalists at the ongoing WAFCON guaranteed a place at next year’s finals, Nigeria, Cameroon, South Africa and Tunisia will have to slug it out for the remaining two slots on Thursday. Nigeria have not missed any of the World Cup finals since its inaugural edition in 1991 and will face a stiff opposition in Cameroon. South Africa and Tunisia will complete the quarter final fixtures.
