Matawalle in a statement by his Special Adviser on Public Enlightenment, Media and Communications, Zailani Bappa, said “All emirs, senior district heads and district heads in the state are hereby directed to officially seek permission from the state government before conferring traditional titles on anyone. “The directive becomes necessary to check indiscriminate award and possible abuse of the traditional institution. Henceforth, no Emir, Senior District Head or District Head should appoint anybody into any traditional office without securing official permission and clearance from the state government. “Compliance to this directive is now mandatory and failure  will attract serious reprimand from the state government.”    THE Zamfara State Police Command, yesterday declared notorious bandit leader, Ado Aleru who was conferred with the title of Sarkin Fulani by the Emir of Yandoto on Saturday in the state, wanted over alleged criminal activities including the killing of no fewer than 100  villagers.
