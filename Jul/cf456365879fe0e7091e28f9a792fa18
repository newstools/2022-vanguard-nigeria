Buhari also presided over the meeting of the National Security Council on July 21. Addressing State House correspondents after the security meeting, the Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, disclosed that the Federal Government might ban the use of motorcycles and mining activities to check banditry and terrorist activities across the country. He said the decision was aimed at curtailing the activities of terrorists, who used motorcycles to perpetrate their evil acts as well as mine solid minerals, and use the proceeds to procure arms. On July 22, President Buhari hosted a delegation from Nasarawa State, where he declared that the off-season elections in Anambra, Ekiti and Osun States had confirmed his administration’s irreversible commitment to credible and violence-free polls in the country. He urged the electorate to vote the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the next general elections to ensure continuity in the polity, and stability in the country and West African region. The president told the high-powered delegation, led by the State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, that the Electoral Act, signed by him earlier this year, was an attestation of the fulfilment of the administration’s determination and commitment to the tenets of the rule of law.
