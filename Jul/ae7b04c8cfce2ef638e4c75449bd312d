We have activated political solution and we are very hopeful that an end is in the purview,”he said. He added:“However, we are in total support of the planned protest by NLC as we believe this will stem up the advocacy and assist in no mean measure to put adequate pressure on the Federal Government to do all that is required to stop the strike.” “I, therefore, direct all NANS structures across the country to mobilise and join NLC protest. ” NANS will only be involved in the mobilization of students to the protest sites and will act based on the direction provided by the NLC. ” NANS structures across the country shall submit to the leadership of NLC all through the protest,”he further said.
