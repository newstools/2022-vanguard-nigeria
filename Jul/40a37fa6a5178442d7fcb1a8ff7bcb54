Uchenna, a mechanic, was gunned down during the sit -at-home on Monday a fortnight ago near his workshop and his motorcycle and working tools set ablaze on the suspicion that he belonged to a cult group. Youths of the area who insisted that Uchenna did not belong to any cult group later protested and marched with the lifeless body of the father of three round the community and the following day, no fewer than fourteen of them were arrested by the police. Although they were asked to go home at the weekend following the intervention of stakeholders in the community, a letter from the Anti Robbery Squad of the Nigeria Police State headquarters, Awka directed them to be at the court on July 12, a development that had further created tension in the area. The letter from the police titled ‘Arraignment Notice’ dated 2nd July read: “Be informed that the above mentioned case of conspiracy / malicious damage will come up in the Chief Magistrate Court, Ogidi on Tuesday, the 12th day of July, 2022 at 8.00 am for arraignment and hearing. “You are requested in your interest to attend the said court in time with at least one person to be your surety if you are granted bail.
