Controversies on who is the eldest among the children of the revered and widely traveled monarch and the heir apparent came up following a report in a gossip magazine and had gone viral on social media. The report claimed that Hassanat Omokehinde Amoke Oyebo (Beere) was born to the monarch by his third wife, Olori Adetokunbo Risikat Oyebo (Nee Dosunmu) is the eldest. Reacting to the report, Oba Adeoriyomi faulted the publication and carpeted the magazine for distorting facts and attempting to cause division within the royal family. According to him, the eldest and heir to the throne is Aremo Abdul-Rasaq Adediran Shangosanya Oyebo born to him by his second wife, Olori Odunola Shakirat Oyebo (Nee Afonja). While speaking at his palace in Egbin on the issue during the presentation of gifts to the pupils of Egbin Kingdom Nursery and Primary School, Oba Oyebo said the clarification became necessary following several calls he has received from concerned individuals who expressed worries about the negative implications the false report could have on the throne, and the need to set the record straight for future purposes. The monarch expressed displeasure at the writer of the earlier report for failure to establish the truth and facts before publishing and described such a report as unprofessional and capable of destroying the unity that has existed in the royal family.
