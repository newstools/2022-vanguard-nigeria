Sokoto state governor, Aminu Waziri has tasked leaders and stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP to stay united in a bid to realize its bid to win the 2023 Presidential election. Tambuwal, a Presidential hopeful on the platform of the PDP said consultations are ongoing preparatory to possible declaration for the big contest. Speaking at a consultative meeting with chairmen of the 36 state chapters of the party at Sokoto state governor’s lodge, Abuja, Tambuwal said PDP is the party to beat in 2023. He said: “Unity of purpose and understanding and working together for us to actually realize the all important goal of rescuing Nigeria is very important. “Consultations are ongoing and we will have to comply with the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC guidelines as a responsible political party. So nothing stops the consultations from continuing. “Our party stands a chance and it is the party to beat in Nigeria today,” he said. Speaking on behalf of his colleagues, Hassan Hyat, chairman of the Kaduna state chapter of PDP said Tambuwal who doubles as chairman of the PDP Governors’ Forum convened the meeting to officially inform them of his intent to vie for the Office of the President in 2023. He called on all aspirants to close ranks and urged them not to forget that the Office of the President would only have a single occupant at any given time. “We are more interested in the unity of the party as our number one cardinal objective because we believe that the party has to come back to rescue Nigeria and we are asking everybody to join forces. “We cannot have more than one President at a time and therefore, among all others, there must be unity of purpose amongst them like just among all other members of the party. We want to move together and we want to make sure that whoever picks the ticket wins the election. “So to us, it is not just an issue of primaries, it is an issue of the secondary election which is more important,” That stated. On his part, former governor of Sokoto State, Attahiru Bafarawa said he is in the “Tambuwal for President” ship because “I know personally he is capable and can do it.” He urged the party chairmen to take their place in the sun by cultivating productive friendships that would impact positively on them even after elections are over. “All aspirants want to see the chairmen now After the elections, they will forget about you.I’m telling you, the man seated with me here (Tambuwal) will never in life abandon you. If I know that he will abandon you, honestly speaking, I will not be with him. So I know who I am following and I am confident that he will never abandon you,” he said. Vanguard News Nigeria
