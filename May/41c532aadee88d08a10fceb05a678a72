Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has congratulated former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, on his nomination as the Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, at the just concluded special convention of the party held weekend in Abuja.  The Governor in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Nathaniel Ikyur noted that the emergence of the former Vice President was ordained by God saying, “in John 3.27, the Bible says ‘A man can receive nothing except it’s given to him from above.’ So, for the benefit of all Nigerians for whom we strive to make society better,  let us now come together under the leadership of the party and be focused to dislodge the APC who have  destroyed the very essence of our nationhood, by winning the 2023 general election to restore the dignity of Nigerians both at home and in the Diaspora.  “Let me therefore on behalf of myself, the government and people of Benue State heartily congratulate His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar, the former Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on his nomination as the Presidential Candidate of our great Party, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, for the 2023 general elections.  “I believe that with your experience and goodwill across all facets of this nation, your election as the standard bearer of the PDP is a clear indication that our party has begun the historic journey back to power in 2023.  “I’m confident that you will put forward your election to restore security in every nook and cranny of the country, revive our collapsed economy, and bring back Nigeria’s dignity where the sanctity of human lives of all Nigerian citizens will be respected. This will also make the social life of every Nigerian much more meaningful as you will rescue Nigeria from bottom to top.”  Governor Ortom who said “the presidential nomination exercise was credible and transparent,” also commended all the other presidential aspirants, especially Governor Nyesom Wike for “exhibiting courage, patriotism and extraordinary spirit of sportsmanship which they displayed throughout their campaigns across the country leading to the National Convention.”  The Governor stressed the need for all patriotic members of the party to unite and ensure the success of the party in the forthcoming general elections “because the unity and supremacy of our party must be respected.” Vanguard News Nigeria
