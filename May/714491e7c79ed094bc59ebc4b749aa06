Tinubu, in a statement signed by Director, Media & Communication, Tinubu Campaign Organisation, Bayo Onanuga, commended Atiku for his patriotism and commitment to Nigeria’s progress. He also congratulated the other contestants for their orderly and peaceful conduct, which he described as a true spirit of democratic sportsmanship. The APC National Leader said  Atiku’s victory  didn’t come as a surprise to Nigerians, because of his vast experience as a statesman and veteran of many presidential contests from 1993.  While welcoming the PDP candidate to the race, Tinubu added that the coming election should be about issues that will improve the quality of life of Nigerians; bring peace, progress, political stability and solve myriad of sociopolitical challenges and insecurity  currently facing the country.  The statement reads, “I welcome the victory of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the just concluded primary. “I look forward to squaring up with him as a worthy opponent in the coming election. I have known the former Vice President as a formidable politician and a patriot who believes in the unity and progress of our dear country. “As we move further into the election season, I charge the PDP presidential candidate and all political actors across Party lines that we should make this election season one that is devoid of bitterness, rancour and strife.  “We should make our campaigns peaceful and issue based. Election season should be a festival of ideas that will uplift our country and improve the living condition of all our people.” It further said, “Unfortunately for the PDP, its candidate will be burdened to explain why Nigerians should give it another opportunity, after squandering 16 years at the central government, without much to show”.  “Nigerians are yet to forget the national ruin and mismanagement of our country for 16 years by successive PDP administration and this bad memory will dog the campaign of the PDP Candidate. “Nevertheless, I once again congratulate our former Vice President for his victory in his party’s primary.”
