Peter Mbah has promised to build on the achievements of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi’s administration, if elected. Mr. Mbah, who made the promise in his acceptance speech after he was declared the winner of the PDP governorship primary election in Enugu State, also pledged to serve the people of the state with humility and moderation, openness and inclusiveness, and simplicity and forthrightness. The industrialist and former Commissioner for Finance in Enugu State, from Owo, Nkanu East Local Government Area, won the PDP governorship primary election with a wide margin of 790 votes out of the 807 votes cast by the delegates to defeat his closest opponent, Hon. Chijioke Edeoga, who scored 9 votes.  Announcing the result of the PDP governorship primary election, the Chairman of the Electoral Committee from the party’s National Working Committee (NWC), Senator Ambuno Zik Sunday added that Sir Chinyeaka Ohaa scored 3 votes while Senator Ike Ekweremadu and Chukwunta Gilbert got one vote each.   Prior to the commencement of voting, eight governorship aspirants out of the 17 contestants stepped down for Barr. Mbah and asked delegates who wanted to vote for them to cast their votes for him.  Speaking further, Barr. Mbah expressed profound gratitude to Gov. Ugwuanyi for enhancing the democratic process of his emergence. He assured the governor that “posterity indeed will reserve a noble seat for you (Ugwuanyi) when the history of this state is written”. Thanking the delegates and other party members for their overwhelming support and solidarity, Barr. Mbah applauded the members of the PDP Governorship Electoral Panel from the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) as well as officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), led by the Enugu State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Dr. Emeka Joseph Ononamadu, for their immense contributions to the peaceful and transparent conduct of the exercise. The Enugu PDP governorship candidate appreciated Senator Jim Ifeanyichukwu Nwobodo for the fatherly role he played during his consultations, disclosing that “Jim as he is fondly called continues to remind us that this is a brotherly affair and this is what we are witnessing here today”. Barr. Mbah equally thanked his co-aspirants especially “those eight aspirants who ceded their ambition for me” for their understanding, cooperation and sacrifices. Commending the State Leadership of the PDP for steadily steering the affairs of the party seamlessly, the PDP governorship candidate went further to appreciate the security agencies and the Fourth Estate of the Realm for their contributions towards the success of the exercise.
