The Amir (president) of the MSSN in Lagos State, Miftahudeen Thanni, said this in a press statement to commemorate the 2022 Children’s Day. He lamented that it’s shameful that the killers of the Northern Muslim families have not been identified, arrested and prosecuted more than three days after the killing became public knowledge. Thanni, who described the recent spate of killings in the country as unfortunate, saying that children are at the receiving end, appealed to the government to ensure the maximum safety of children in the country. He said, “That the situation of Nigeria will degenerate to this is unthinkable. Wiping out a family is callous, inhumane and animalistic. “It’s shameful that three days after the incident happened, no arrest,  no prosecution. For how long will criminals continue to walk freely in our nation? “These are the worst times for our children and youths. The Nigerian situation is tiring. “By now, we expect that all those involved should have been arrested and tried. There should be no ethnic or religious colouration of crimes and punishment of criminals. “We pray that Allah descends from peace, tranquillity and unity in Nigeria so that we shall all be proud of the nation.” The Muslim student leader, however, commiserated with the family of the deceased and prayed God will admit them into paradise. While warning against reprisal, Thanni also condemned the killing of a Christian in Sokoto over alleged blasphemy. He said, “We implore the youth and citizens, in general, to always be law-abiding, peace-loving and tolerant. We should all learn from the incident that happened in Sokoto where a female student was regrettably killed. “The actions of the killers do not represent Islam. The gruesome murder of the student in Sokoto is unlawful and un-Islamic. Islam is a religion of peace and denounces terrorism, injustice and jungle justice at any rate. We urge the youths to be calm and tolerant whenever they see things that displease them,”he said. Thanni noted that the right thing to do is to report to the appropriate authorities. He said, “It is also unacceptable to blaspheme in all religions, however, if this occurs it is not an opportunity to do jungle justice. Government must ensure that this ugly incident does not repeat itself as stiffer measures should be imposed on people doing jungle justice and those that blaspheme. “It is more painful that the condemnable act happened among students who should know better. The action of the students who killed their colleagues defeats the purpose of education,” he added. Vanguard News Nigeria
