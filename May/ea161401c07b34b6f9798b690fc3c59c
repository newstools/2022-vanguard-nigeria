Despite the cancellation of Thursday’s sit-at-home order by the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPoB, miscreants have razed a commercial tricycle and motorcycle along Echara Road in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State. According to eyewitness accounts, the incident happened in the early hours of Thursday morning at the aforementioned road, close to the building materials market. Some of the residents who pleaded for anonymity said the incident happened at about 6 am when the building materials market was yet to open for businesses. Though no life was lost in the incident, the tricycle and motorcycle were burnt beyond repair. READ ALSO: Residents who spoke to Vanguard expressed shock, adding that the enforcers were not updated on the directives from IPoB. Consequently, all commercial activities were paralyzed in the university town following the incident as banks and major markets were shut. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, of the Enugu State Police Command, Daniel Ndukwe, told Vanguard that he was yet to get official report on the incident. However, subsequent attempts made to make him speak on the incident proved abortive as he claimed to be out of Enugu State. Vanguard News Nigeria
