It will be recalled that operatives of the anti-graft agency had last Tuesday, May 24, arrested Okorocha at his Abuja residence, in an operation that lasted over seven hours. The arrest followed alleged refusal by the former governor to make himself available for trial. EFCC accused him of deliberately evading service of the charge on him. Okorocha, who piloted affairs of Imo state from 2011 to 2019, was charged before the court following his alleged complicity in a N2.9billion fraud.
