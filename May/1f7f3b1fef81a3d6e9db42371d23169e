Commenting on the development, National President, Association of Mobile Money and Bank agents,   Mr Olojo Victor attributed the decline in the MoM e-payment transactions to the decline in the economic power of Nigerians. He said: “If there were a decline in PoS transactions, I would have said it is due to lack of agents but we have over a million Mobile Money agents across the country and more terminals being deployed. Then it becomes obvious that the decline across all e-payment channels is due to the state of the economy. This has limited the power of Nigerians to carry out banking activities through these channels. The exchange rate and ease of doing business are also affecting transactions. It is when you have money and businesses are thriving that money moves across the economy.”
