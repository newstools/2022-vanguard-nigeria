Mustapha is one of the two aspirants on the platform of APC contesting with the incumbent Governor,  Babajide Sanwo-Olu. The other contestant, in a primary scheduled for today, is Olawale Oluwo. Coordinator, Mustapha4Lagos Agenda, Bukola Ogundipe, alleged that the plot to get Mustapha screened out is being orchestrated from the camp of the incumbent Governor, saying Sanwo-Olu had allegedly enlisted the support of some elements within the screening committee to perfect the plan. Ogundipe said: “We have uncovered a plot to disqualify our aspirant from the race. They know that the only way they can stop Mustapha from getting the party ticket is to make sure he doesn’t participate in the primary. Let us forget about the noise they are making, he is the man to beat. “We are very certain that their plot will not see the light of the day because Mustapha is clean and meets all the criteria required by the constitution of our party and the guidelines for the elections. “As we speak, our lawyers have met with the leadership of our party in Abuja to make sure that this evil plot does not see the light of the day. “The national body must step up and quash this evil plan. Sanwo-Olu has been throwing money around, spending billions to buy people, but this is about the future of our state.” and the leadership of our party in Lagos knows that we can’t continue with the abysmal performance of the incumbent.” APC c’ttee reacts Reacting to the allegation, Chairman of a nine-man state committee for the Governorship, State and National Assembly primaries slated for May 26 and May 27, who is APC Zonal Organising Secretary, Lateef Ibirogba, debunked the statement by the group, saying,”there is no iota of truth in the claim.” “In as much as we don’t want to join issues with any of the groups because APC is known for democratic tendencies. We are assuring every aspirant of level playing field. The allegation is only a figment of their imagination, we urge them to go and get ready for the exercise by doing their home work. There is no favouritism in this exercise. We are offering aspirant a level playing ground. They can take this to the bank.”
