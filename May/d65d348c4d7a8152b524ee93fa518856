Our money will speak for us, from wherever it is, it will avenge!” See tweets below: Greetings Mummy Bim(@mummybimz) as I fondly called you.

Can you please send him the money? Thank u🤗 pic.twitter.com/m6kUoi0zWK Upon all my peaceful pleading, Mme Bimbola Okpere has blocked me here, for asking her to pay money we contributed.
