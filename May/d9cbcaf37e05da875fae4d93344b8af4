So we are using Ibadan, we are using Bauchi, we are using Port Harcourt, we are using here and we are using Kaduna”. Mustapha explained that candidates in the Southeast have been advised to pick centres outside the region to enable them participate in the interview process.  “We sent them mails to choose any centre. In all the geopolitical zones we have, you can actually choose any centre that you want. You may be in the South East and you decide to come and do it in Abuja, or you can even go to Bauchi”. While declining to indicate the exact number of candidates that would be finally selected for the scholarship award, he said the number would be dependent on the budget of the Fund. He noted that at the end of their training abroad, the scholars were expected to return to the country to work in the petroleum industry and contribute their quota to growth of the Nigerian economy.
