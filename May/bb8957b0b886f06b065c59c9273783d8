Comrade Adewale, in the petition sighted by Vanguard, alleged that the state party chairman, in connivance with some leaders of the party in Oriade LCDA and Amuwo Odofin Local Government Area manipulated the local government’s delegates list and the entire process leading to the primary election in favour of Prince Sanusi. Adewale who is the immediate-past chairman of Amuwo Odofin Local Government also insisted in the petition that Prince Lasisi was not qualified to run for the position of House of Representatives because he was disqualified by the House of Assembly in 2019 for presenting fake United States academic documents at the screening stage for the state executive cabinet when his name was put forward as a commissioner nominee. He therefore requested that the appeal committee calls for the report of the house assembly screening committee that screened and disqualified Prince Sanusi for presentation of fake academic result. “I further request that Prince Lanre Sanusi be disqualified and removed as the APC House of Representative candidate for Amuwo Odofin Federal Constituency and that i be given the ticket of the APC to contest as the candidate of the APC party”, he said.
