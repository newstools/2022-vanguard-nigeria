The Reds can complete a cup treble on Saturday if they beat Real Madrid in Paris. And Jurgen Klopp is hoping to outthink Carlo Ancelotti by using the latest cutting edge technology. But the brains behind Liverpool’s Champions League plan come courtesy of German neuroscientist Dr Niklas Hausler and his business partner Patrick Hantschke. As revealed by The Athletic last year, Liverpool have employed the co-founders of company neuro11 in order to improve their stars by helping them reach their optimum mental state. The technology is specially designed to train the brain directly. As a result those using the technology are in the optimum mental condition necessary to perform to the highest level. Ahead of this Saturday’s mouthwatering clash in Paris, full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Kostas Tsimikas were spotted sporting the tech. Electrodes were attached to them in order to gather data that can be used to individually tailor their training programmes. The neuro11 website describes themselves as “state-of-the-art mental strength training for athletes.”
