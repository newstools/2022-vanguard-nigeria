Teejay Yusuf, has urged his supporters and members of the Peoples Democratic Party to stop mocking Senator Dino Malaye over the loss of the party’s ticket to him. Yusuf defeated Melaye in the keenly contested PDP primary for the party’s sole ticket for the Kogi West Senatorial District. The House of Reps member said this in a message of appreciation made available in Abuja, on Wednesday. He said the “Ongoing mockery of Senator Dino Melaye over his loss of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Kogi West Senatorial District primaries; is a needless and very unhelpful that should be stopped immediately. “My brother, Senator Dino Melaye did not waste time in conceding victory to me; no matter what anyone thinks, he is a good man and a good  politician who will remain relevant well beyond 2023. “Senator Melaye was a worthy opponent and irrespective of who wins the forthcoming PDP presidential primaries, he would continue to be relevant; I strongly appeal that all those mocking my brother should stop immediately as such disposition is needless, unwarranted and very unhelpful to our common cause. “In fact, while I thank all our elders at home and abroad as well as all our party leaders and eminent non-PDP citizens who consistently  called delegates to ensure votes for me, I must thank Senator Dino Melaye for his immediate concession speech and brotherly disposition which did not just begin today.” In a related development, the Kogi West Democratic Initiative which took part in mobilizing citizens in the area to consistently urge delegates towards ensuring Yusuf’s victories in the PDP Senatorial primaries also noted that a long history of welfarist commitment helped Teejay Yusuf through. The group’s head, Mr. Joseph Ilori said, “With his victory in the Tuesday run-off election, Teejay Yusuf re-enacted two electoral victories against Melaye in both the 2011 PDP House of Representatives primary ticket and the subsequent elections during which Melaye decamped to the All Nigeria People’s Party”.
