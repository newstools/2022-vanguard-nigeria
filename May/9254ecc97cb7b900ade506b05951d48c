Director of the human rights group, Deji Adeyanju, in a statement made available to Vanguard in Lagos, Wednesday, noted that the need to protect the electoral process during the forthcoming presidential primaries can not be overemphasized Also Read 2023: Don’t bow to pressure of shifting electoral timetable, Jega tells INEC Adeyanju claimed that some presidential aspirants in the two leading political parties in Nigeria have concluded plans to monetize the upcoming primaries by inducing the delegates at the point of voting in a “show your vote scheme.” The statement reads partly, “This scheme is perfected where the delegates stealthy shows their vote to the aspirant or his representative before dropping the same in the ballot box, in return for immediate financial gains. “As a pro-good governance organization, we have deemed it necessary to immediately draw your attention to this scandalous plan and urge you to take urgent steps towards providing a watertight security around the polling booth during the presidential primaries.” It further said, “It should be noted that party primaries is one of the most important steps in the electoral process, as it heralds the formal nomination of presidential candidates, culminating in the general elections. Accordingly, where the primaries are flawed, the sanctity of the general election will ultimately be called to question. “We also use this medium so Nigerians must be allowed to choose their representatives in a free and fair contest without any manipulation of the electoral process. Only then can the nation rise again from its ashes. Please protect the sanctity of our electoral process.” Vanguard News Nigeria
