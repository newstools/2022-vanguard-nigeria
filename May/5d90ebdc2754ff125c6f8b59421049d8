After the girls left, the boys came to meet me that they have been monitoring me all this while. “I told them that I no longer have nothing against them and that when I had issue with them was when I was pregnant, and after I gave birth, I have let them be. “They insisted that no, I should go and call my soldiers, that they are now ready for the case and that they will fight me. “One of them (Jamiu) approached me and hit me with a stick. After beating me with the stick, I rushed home to pick a knife and I returned to the riverbank.
