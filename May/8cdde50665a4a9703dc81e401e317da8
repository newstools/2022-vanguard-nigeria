Ikonne secured 468 to defeat his closest rival, Mayor Lucky Igbokwe who polled 45 votes, while Mrs. Ezenwanyi Jonah got five votes. Seven aspirants including the Deputy Governor, Sir Ude Oko Chukwu; Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe; and Senator Emma Nwaka had earlier withdrawn from the race, citing use of fake news and non-compliance with due process. Despite pulling from the race, Oko-chukwu got six votes, Nana Nwafor scored four votes, while Senator Nwaka also got four votes. Senator Abaribe got five votes, Chief Ncheta Omerekpe secured three votes, Prof. Gregory Ibe who has since joined the All Progressive Grand Alliance, APGA, got two votes, while Chief Sampson Orji scored five. Eight votes were voided. The total number of votes cast was 544 votes while eight votes were voided. The returning officer of the primary election, Chief Ayo Fayose declared Ikonne the winner of the election. In their acceptance speech, Ikonne promised to institute a participatory government if elected governor. The former VC urged all aggrieved members of the party to cooperate with him to win the election.
