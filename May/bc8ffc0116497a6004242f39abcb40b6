The CBN disclosed this in its Economic Report for January 2022. According to the apex bank, forex inflow dropped YoY by 20.3 per cent to $4.36 billion in January 2022 from $5.47 billion in January 2021. However, forex outflow through the economy rose by 14.8 per cent to $3.41 billion in January 2022 from $2.97 billion in January 2021.
