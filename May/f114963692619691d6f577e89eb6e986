Two time Oscar winner, actor Kevin Spacey has been charged with four counts of sexual offences against three men. The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed on Thursday that the offences involved three men. Spacey, 62, was charged after evidence was reviewed following complaints between 2005 and 2013. Rosemary Ainslie, CPS Special Crime Division Head said the Service “authorized criminal charges for four counts of sexual assault against three men”. In a release, she disclosed Spacey has been charged with “causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent”. Ainslie announced that the evidence earlier gathered was rechecked by the Metropolitan Police. “The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against Mr Spacey are active and that he has the right to a fair trial”, the statement reads. The incidents are alleged to have taken place in London and Gloucestershire. The first charge was about an alleged sexual assault in London in March 2005. The second alleged victim claimed to have been assaulted in London in August 2008. The third complainant relates to an alleged assault in Gloucestershire in April 2013. Spacey began his career in the 1980s as a stage actor and rose to fame and wealth. He has won two Oscars and other notable awards. Vanguard News Nigeria
