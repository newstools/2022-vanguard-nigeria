It would be recalled that the Party’s primary elections were peacefully conducted and candidates have emerged for the diverse positions. A former Governor of the State, Jonah Jang has commended the aspirants and delegates for their peaceful conduct and congratulated the flagbearers, stressing that the PDP is set on winning ways. Jang, through his Media Consultant, Clinton Garuba noted, “The just concluded primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party in Plateau State which were held under a free and fair atmosphere without any kind of rancour is a sign of good things soon to be experienced in the State. The outcome of the primaries will best be described as no victor no vanquished, as all the aspirants gave a good account of themselves and congratulated one another for a good contest. “The party is set to be on winning ways again as it has shown that it is the true party for the state, one which is guaranteed to bring relief to the sufferings that citizens of the state have had to endure in the last seven years. The years past have indeed been full of agony and untold suffering for the people but succour is on the way with the emergence of the various candidates for various positions in the PDP. “While we congratulate our candidates for the various positions, we must also applaud the many aspirants who sought to represent the party. Their demonstration of sportsmanship in all the primaries is worthy of commendation. Those who won are just one among many equals. The outcome is a call to unity for all our stakeholders to return to the various constituencies to begin to engage with the people to vote in a new paradigm that guarantees a better life for our people. “The PDP family has shown that unity of purpose is a core ingredient in achieving set goals, we must therefore return to the trenches as we prepare for the secondary election, knowing that we are up against a ruthless opponent whose stock in trade is propaganda without performance. The Plateau people must show their dissatisfaction with nonperformance and begin to mobilize, toward aligning with those who have not only shown empathy but are more concerned about guaranteeing a secured, peaceful, and developed Plateau for now and the coming generations.” He added, “We especially, congratulate Barr. Caleb Mutfwang for emerging as the PDP gubernatorial flagbearer and call on him to hit the ground running in joining forces with the other aspirants who sought the ticket to begin to harmonize ideas, insights, and concepts on how to prosecute the forthcoming general elections and put the state back in its right place, in national reckoning and international visibility.”
