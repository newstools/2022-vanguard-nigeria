His apology came, following the caution by Peter Obi to  his supporters to refrain from attacking the personality of other aspirants and candidates under the guise of support his presidential bid. Omokri, a former spokesman to former President Goodluck Jonathan and member of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), while reacting to Obi’s exit from the PDP to Labour Party, (LP) on Arise TV, had described Obi as opportunistic, saying LP conflicts his (Obi’s) ideology.
