In a press statement issued by its Executive Director, Nelson Ekujumi, the group stated that “We are horrified and devastated by the latest gruesome murder of a pregnant woman, her four children, and six other persons, all of the northern extraction in Isulo, Orumba North local government council area of Anambra state on Sunday 22nd of May 2022 as reported in the media and which was confirmed by police authorities.” According to the statement, “We condemn in the strongest terms, this latest provocative and heinous killing which has assumed an ethnic dimension and portends grave danger to national peace and security.” CSER is disturbed and worried that “If these dastardly acts in the South East are not confronted frontally with all the seriousness it deserves, we, as a country, might be playing with a time bomb that can explode at any time and imperil our humanity.” The group then went on to condemn the complicity and conspiratorial silence of elites, elders, interest groups, and persons of South-East extraction, their supporters, and acolytes outside the region who devised the evil agenda of fuelling the terrorist group, IPOB to cause mayhem because of political expediency, fraudulently disguised as ethnic agitations for freedom. CSER notes with sadness that the terrorist group IPOB like Boko Haram had perpetuated a lot of killings of innocent civilians and security agents as well as arsonist attacks on security agencies facilities, and public and private assets and had only recently beheaded a lawmaker of the Anambra State House of assembly which is utterly despicable, reprehensible, callous and condemnable. The group while commiserating with the families of the slain persons and wishing the dead eternal rest, called on security agencies to go all out against these terrorists, sponsors and supporters with the full weight of the law in order to send a clear signal that their days of committing crimes against humanity are numbered. According to CSER, since Anambra State is gradually descending into a state of anarchy, the federal government is hereby called upon to take over full responsibility for the security of life and property in Anambra State as law and order has broken down irretrievably and must be restored within the confines of provisions of the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria.
