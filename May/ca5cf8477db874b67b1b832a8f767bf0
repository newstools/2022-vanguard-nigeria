Also, the market capitalisation rose by N346 billion to N28.353 trillion from N28.007 trillion the previous day. Analysis of the day’s trading showed that sentiments remained weak as FBN Holding (-8.66%) fell by 8.66 per cent, while investors continued to sell off Lafarge Africa Plc, GTCO and International Breweries Plc’s shares, which fell by 5.53 per cent, 2.6 per cent and 6.25 per cent respectively.
