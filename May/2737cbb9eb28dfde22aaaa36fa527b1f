Felix Morka, National Publicity Secretary of the party said in a late Monday statement that the National Working Committee NWC of the APC had approved the review on Tuesday. The statement equally ruled out participation by statutory or super delegates, following the refusal of President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the Electoral Act 2022 Amendment Bill which would have provided roles for such category of delegates. 2023: Why Osinbajo’s Message To APC Delegates is Crucial to Nigeria’s Future In Tuesday’s revised timetable, the governorship primary elections would hold on Thursday 26th May with only state delegates voting. The primary elections for the State Assemblies would hold on the same day but with local government delegates voting. However, the party has swapped the dates for Senatorial and House of Representatives primary elections. On Friday, local government delegates would vote in the House of Representatives primary elections and do the same for the Senatorial primary elections on 28th May. APC added, “that the Special Convention for the Presidential Primary will be held as scheduled on Sunday, 29th – Monday, 30th of May, 2022”. Vanguard News Nigeria
