Barely a day after the terrorists who attacked an Abuja-Kaduna train threatened to start killing the abducted train passengers if their demands were not met, the terrorists have released another video showing the captives including a Pakistani Nationale begging the authorities to come to their rescue.  The  Pakistani Nationale who was seen in the video wearing a white shirt said in English that he was among the 62 abductees and the condition in which they were kept was not so good. ” I am appealing to the government of Pakistan and the government of Nigeria and to the whole world, International community to help us,” he said. READ ALSO: Two other male abductees and 3 females in the video, including one who could not hold back tears, pleaded with the Nigerian government and the Kaduna State Government to accede to the terrorists’ demands and rescue them. In the video, a terrorist in an Army uniform, who covered his face with a turban was seen holding a gun, directing the captives to speak one after the other, and had at a point asked one of the women in Hausa language to speak louder.  ” Please accede to their ( terrorists)demands to enable us go home,”  the abducted train passengers selected to feature in the video, had continued to beg the authorities.  Vanguard News Nigeria
