Without this, the stakeholders who gathered at the second Refining & Specifications Virtual Workshop organised by the African Refiners and Distributors Association (ARDA) noted that  achieving net-zero, Paris Agreement and other agreements targeting cleaner environment may remain elusive. With growing divestment and capital reallocation away from hydrocarbons and into renewables/energy transition, the stakeholders noted that consideration for Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) is the downstream segment of Africa’s petroleum industry now remained a key leeway to the over $15.7 billion required for the continent to improve its refineries.  Speaking at the event, Oil and Refining Research Analyst at Vitol, Maryro Mendez noted that despite the withdrawal of fund from fossil, investment with sustainability plan is on the rise. Quoting a Bloomberg statistics, she noted that sustainable debt annual issuance now hovers around $824.7 billion as capital raised for renewables and PE funds now dominate the energy sector.  Mendez noted that 66 carbon regimes around the world leads to a lack of carbon policy, price and timing of implementation. According to her, lack of uniform policies make it difficult for refineries to pass on the cost of carbon to its customers as carbon price shifts the cost burden of climate change, from society as a whole to the entities responsible for the emissions, providing lack of incentive for refiners to reduce emissions. “The refining sector accounts for only three per cent of the global energy sector emissions. While refineries contribution to global energy sector emissions is low, the opportunities for reducing them are significant. Refineries globally have started thinking about measuring, monitoring and reducing carbon emissions Environmental sustainability has to be a priority for refiners and Africa is no exception,” Mendez said.  She decried that 80 per cent of refinery carbon emissions come from fuel combustion, hence fuel source and energy optimisation would present the biggest opportunity to reduce emissions. Mendez stated that as a number of options exist for refiners, the technologies already exist to develop a refinery that has net zero carbon emissions, adding “The challenge is not technical but is commercial with facilities requiring sufficient incentive and capital to invest without impacting on their competitive positionExecutive Secretary of ARDA, Anibor Kragha, who had noted that adoption of harmonized specification would halt importation of fuels not meeting the AFRI specs into Africa and give existing refineries until 2030 to upgrade their facilities to produce the cleaner, lower sulphur AFRI-6 (10 ppm) specifications noted that targeted financing is urgently needed for projects to upgrade refineries and infrastructure to produce and transport Cleaner Fuels. According to him, Africa suffers from modest utilisation, with a few bright spots, compared to other regions. He noted that there is currently uneven progress in tightening specifications across Africa, adding that African Union and ARDA are collaborating on adoption of AFRI Fuels Roadmap“New process units required are to improve key fuel specifications, especially Naptha Hydrotreater (NHdT), Diesel Hydro-desulph. (DHDS), Benzene Extraction, Sulphur and  Hydrogen Plants.
