The reports were released by AIB Commissioner, Engineer Akin Olateru at the bureau headquarters in Abuja. According to Olateru, the bureau has proffered seven safety recommendations on the Max Air accident. He explained that the aircraft with registration marks 5N-DBK, Flight NGL2092 departed King Abdul Aziz International Airport, Jeddah; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, (OEJN) with returning Hajj pilgrims bound for Minna Airport, Nigeria, (DNMN). ” The aircraft touched down on the right of the centreline of RWY 05 with the left main wheels first and the number one engine nacelle impacted the runway and was dragged along the runway centreline.” “AIB identified excessive rudder and aileron inputs at short finals phase of the approach as causal factors while decision to continue the ILS approach runway 05 with erratic localizer signals and an un-stabilized approach with a no go-around decision as contributory factors.,” the bureau revealed. On the Azman Air flight which got Seven (7) Safety recommendations, and one immediate recommendation directed to the NCAA, the AIB revealed that the ” casual factor was a result of failure of number 4 and 5 bearings of engine number 2 leading to loss of power during approach of the aircraft”. Contributory factors according to the AIB include, ” failure to recognise the abnormal engine conditions (surge) during cruise phase and hence, not making appropriate decision. This might have been connected to the insufficient technical knowledge and loss of situational awareness.” “Other are non implementation of the Flight Data Monitoring programme in accordance with 2.2.5.1 of Azman Air Safety Management System Manual, non rectification of the number two engine vibration anomalies recorded over a period of 8 months, inadequate regulatory oversight of the Azman Air Safety Management System”. On the Cessna Citation 560 XLS+ aircraft with registration marks 5N-HAR operated by the Nigeria Police (NP) five (5) safety recommendations were prescribed. “The causal factor for the crash which had six(6)passengers on board was uncoordinated flight as a result of inadequate Crew Resource Management (CRM) that led to the partial release of parking brake, which resulted in rejected take-off while the contributory factors were the inability of the aircraft to get airborne after attaining the rotation speed (Vr)during take-off roll even with aft elevator pressure.” “The other was non-adherence to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) as contained in the Cessna Citation 560 XLS+ Airplane Flight Manual,” the AIB Commissioner revealed.
