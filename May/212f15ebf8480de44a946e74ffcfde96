He described the exercise as a journey by the state chapter of the party towards self destruction because basic tenets of democracy have been observed in the breach. He said this in a statement made public, in Abuja, on Wednesday. Abaribe who is seeking to contest the Abia State Governorship election notes that the last couple of weeks has been tortuous as he and several other loyal party faithful battled hard to navigate the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), away from a self destructive path. According to him, the essence of the struggle was to create an unfettered democratic space and a level playing field for all aspirants vying for all elective offices in the state, to participate equally in the primary elections. He said, “That was not the case and of course what we are witnessing is a shambolic process driven by a procured court injunction. “To make matters worse, the use of only an imaginary 3-man Adhoc delegates to the exclusion of the party’s statutory delegates in the primary elections to elect our candidates even when INEC the nation’s electoral umpire, has unequivocally stated that no congress held in Abia State for that purpose, has no doubt put the party and her candidates in a quagmire. “The implication for our party is grave and as such has put all ongoing primary exercises on quick sand. “I am known for standing firm in defence of my convictions for the right of all people to a free and fair democratic process. “That was why my campaign set sail on a democratic journey that took us to all the nooks and crannies of our dear state.  “We covered all the local governments and we could see the enthusiasm on the faces of our people who are desirous of change to a progressive government with a human face. “We committed human and material resources, preaching the ‘Rise Up Abia’ message for the total emancipation of our State from the drudgery of imposition and godfatherism, which has seen the state at the lowest rung of infrastructural, human and material development index among the states of the federation. “ Abaribe declared that Abians are tired of being subjected to being the butt of jokes and ridicule from their peers, particularly those from the contiguous states that were hitherto far behind Abia State in the development index in the time past. That, according to him, was the narrative he and his supporters sought to change when the campaign took off. He said it was unfortunate that these ugly developments ignited by a “rapacious ambition to maintain the wicked governance status quo of imposition and godfatherism have aborted this quest in PDP. “ The minority leader announced that “Accordingly, I Senator Enyinnaya Harcourt Abaribe will not be part of this charade. “I am therefore not participating in the exercise, which means that I will not be part of the PDP governorship primary election that holds in Abia State on Wednesday 25th of May, 2022 as doing so would have amounted to endorsement of an illegality that is already being challenged in the courts.“ He appealed to the people of the state especially his supporters to remain calm.
