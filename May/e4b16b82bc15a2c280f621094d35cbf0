The next President of Nigeria must not be a Mafioso leader. Our President must not be a gangster!” He added that “as a party in government, the APC has a sacred and patriotic duty to guide a disciplined transfer of power not one left in the hands of the god of mammon.” While noting that the APC, being the party of the sitting President, Olawepo-Hashim argued that a lot is expected from it in terms of direction and leadership, adding that the government still has a lot of  leverage and  political enforcement mechanisms beyond money. The former Presidential  candidate noted that “national interest is what should guide the choice of the APC and some of the urgent national imperative should include shortlisting a candidate that will heal the wounds of division in the country and finding also a Vice  that will compliment him/her in this national objective.” He recalled that “In 1979, President Shehu Shagari was initially a senatorial aspirant who was drafted into the Presidential race and went ahead to win .On the political turf then there were many money bags who were nicely told to back off because Nigeria’s Presidency is not for sale.” He equally noted that Peter Obi did quit the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, under the excuse that the build up to the convention has been seriously monetized and that “Pius Anyim former Senate President could not hide his frustration that the voting did not reflect the current issues germane to the nation.” Olawepo-Hashim therefore enjoined the Party’s Screening Committee to “ be serious about the exercise of screening.  The EFCC must be ready to follow large movement of illicit cash for politics and   seize where necessary, laundered funds in circulation and prosecute offenders.” He also re-emphasised the fact that “the question of nomination of flag bearers are exclusive matters for parties and party priorities and national interest are the highest imperative and nothing else.” According to him, political parties are constitutionally recognised institutions  and the only area in their affairs where INEC is permitted to interfere in their affairs is seeking to collect  their audited accounts  through her Auditors and the body is expected to forward same to the National  Assembly. “Even the National Assembly and the courts have limited scope for interventions in party affairs under section  222.The Constitution restricts this purely to when there  are criminal infractions this is provided for in Section 223. “That the PDP made a mess of itself by rushing into its Primaries does not mean that the APC and other political parties must do so.” He also argued that “parties have up to August 25 under section 29.1 of Electoral  Act 2022 to close their nomination  not as stipulated by INEC guidelines.”
