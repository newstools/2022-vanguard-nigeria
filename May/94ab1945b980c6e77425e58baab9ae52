Draw The Line provides a platform for Africa’s most powerful narrators to change this trajectory, disrupt political apathy, and lead the fight to end this treatable and preventable disease which kills a child nearly every minute.”  “Growing up in Nigeria I have known malaria forever and experienced the disease countless times, so I understand how this disease robs so many children of their ability to go to schools and why malaria is a major cause of school absenteeism. I believe all children should have equal opportunities to realize their full potential and that’s why I’m here because we can end one of the deadliest preventable diseases of all time,” said singer and Zero Malaria Ambassador, Yemi Alade while speaking on her involvement with the campaign.  The campaign film directed by Ridley Scott’s protégé and Grammy award winner, Meji Alabi commented on joining the campaign, “I love the energy and approach of this campaign harnessing the power of African inspired art, music, sport, fashion, and culture to drive positive change and build on the bold truth that we can end malaria. It can’t come soon enough – I was very ill in hospital last year with malaria, it was debilitating. In this day and age, no one should have to suffer from this preventable disease.”  Zero Malaria Ambassador and Art Director for the campaign, Láolú Senbanjo expressed his enthusiasm of creating the Muundo visual language during the first phase of the campaign and steering the creative direction in the second phase, “I’m honoured to have my art at the heart of this campaign expressing our opportunity for zero malaria. Growing up in Nigeria means I know malaria well – it’s a part of everyday life. It is heart- breaking that today that Nigeria remains one of the worst affected countries with over 25 per cent of all malaria cases and deaths – so this is a very personal battle for me.”  Emphasising the importance of the fund, Dr Corine Karema, Interim CEO of the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, “In addition to the innovation of new tools, we must invest in the country health systems and programmes needed to ensure these tools and resources target the right people and right places, at the right time. The Global Fund plays a critical role in delivering life-saving malaria services where they are needed most. This year, it is vital that we see a fully replenished Global Fund get back on track and accelerate the malaria response to end this disease and strengthen health systems, creating a safer, healthier, and more equal world for all”.  In a critical year in the fight to end one of the world’s oldest and deadliest diseases within a generation, with game-changing high-level summits in both Rwanda and the USA, global stars have joined forces with youth and scientists from around the world, to turn up the pressure on world leaders to commit to ending malaria and invest funds totaling $18 billion at the  Global Fun’s Seventh Replenishment,  in the next exciting phase of the multi-award-winning Draw the Line Against Malaria   campaign.  Over the past year the ground-breaking campaign, developed by Dentsu International in 2021 as a youth pillar of the global Zero Malaria Starts With Me movement, has united people across the world at a time when malaria kills a child every minute, generating over 35 million engagements across the campaign’s website and social media channels.  The Federal Government of Nigeria has invested in malaria prevention strategies and tools, including investment in antimalarial drugs through its partnership with the Global Fund, USAID’s President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) and other non-governmental players.  In April 2021, the Federal Government of Nigeria led by the Honourable Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire launched the Global Fund 2021-2023 Malaria grant, which aims to not just reduce the malaria burden, but eliminate it. During the flag-off, he said “Malaria remains a public health challenge. While Nigeria witnessed the largest reduction in malaria death in 2019 …we must be mindful of other challenges posed by COVID- 19 and work to mitigate the impact. We appreciate all the partners that have been working with us to achieve the desired goal.”
