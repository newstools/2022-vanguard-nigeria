By Ibrahim Hassan-Wuyo  Adam Sambo, son of former Vice President Namadi Sambo who was defeated at the PDP primaries for the Kaduna North Federal Constituency, has said that it was a directive given by the major stakeholders of the PDP  that any sum given to delegates by various aspirants for their support should be returned to those unsuccessful in the primary elections. He said in a statement on Wednesday that “I would like to state that as a matter of fact, there was nothing ‘dramatic’ about the request, and it is unfortunate the media has been purporting it as such.” ” Delegates themselves are aware of the directives given by the major stakeholders of the PDP in the Kaduna North Constituency, that any sum given to delegates by various aspirants for their support should be returned to those unsuccessful in their primary elections.” “This was done to encourage delegates to vote for the aspirants based on their qualities and not just their perceived spending power, and to hold them accountable for the candidates they put forth.” He  said “as a mark of respect for that agreement, some delegates in the Kaduna North constituency have started to reach out to unsuccessful State House of Assembly aspirants….. followed by my fellow contender, Shehu Usman ABG and I. Therefore, I am not acting in isolation or making any ludicrous demands.” “I have taken the decision in good faith and will continue to support the PDP and do my best to protect its good fortunes.”
