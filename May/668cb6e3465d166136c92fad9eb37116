Over 100 motorcyclists had attacked the Same Global Estate in the Lokogoma area after a motorist reportedly hit the riders and ran into the estate for safety. There is an official ban on activities of the commercial motorcyclists in most parts of the city including the main road in Lokogoma. Residents of the estate said the rider had set two houses ablaze while trying to apprehend the motorist. The Estate Manager, Mr Adebisi Adelowo, speaking on the incident said; “Over 100 Hausa bike riders attacked our estate some hours ago. They tried to burn down the estate by putting fire to two buildings. “They pulled down our gate and started stoning people’s houses. We couldn’t stop them until the police and the army intervened. “We later learnt that they attacked our estate because two of their colleagues were knocked to death by a motorist who ran to our estate for safety as he was being chased with big stones and other dangerous weapons. “The motorist who is not even a resident of our estate ran into the estate because he noticed a police post in front of the estate.” The riders had few days ago set the Dei Dei Building materials market on fire after one of them rammed his motorcycle into an articulated vehicle, killing his female passenger in the process. Traders had promptly intercepted his motorcycle, a development which made the riders to go on rampage.
