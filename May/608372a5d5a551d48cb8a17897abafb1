The All Progressives Congress, APC’s presidential aspirant, while addressing Osun State delegates at Government House, in Osogbo, said aspirants from the zone, including Bola Tinubu, have right to contest the exalted office. “Some people think there is a big battle going on within our fold, but it is not true. I told Tinubu that I am coming here today. So, people must not inherit an enemy that does not exist. What is important is the progress of our people; what is important is that the South-West must succeed. I want to assure you that there will be a collective result to the success of the region. “This aspiration is a family business in the southwest. No quarrel in the family, no matter what happens as long as southwest wins, we are all victorious. “We are sons and daughters of Oodua, and our values remain constant. We are leaders in the progressive movement, no one is not eminently qualified right from our leader, Bola Tinubu, the VP, Professor Yemi Osinbajo or Senator Ibikunle Amosun even Reverend Tunde Bakare…we are driven by the same beliefs, passion and commitment to improving the condition of our people, that is what is driving us.” “I have not come with any sense of entitlement. My friend, Governor Oyetola will not be happy if I did not come to Osun. I am unapologetically committed to the success of Oyetola. “For me, coming here today, the party in Osun must be informed about my aspiration, for me to seek your solidarity and support, it does not matter, if you don’t make me number one, make me number two. Politics cannot separate us. It is just the interest of our people that matters. “Osun is home for me, I have not come here to campaign, I have come to beg you that you should not forget your brother.” Meanwhile, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola while speaking, described Fayemi as a brother who stood by him at the most critical time, praying that the God grant the Governor’s aspirations.
